c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\138279\1255-138279-0016.flac SAID THE BLURRED SPOT IN THE SNOW TREMULOUSLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\138279\1255-138279-0017.flac I ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORGIVE ME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\138279\1255-138279-0018.flac WELL I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\138279\1255-138279-0019.flac O MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MARRIED FRANK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\138279\1255-138279-0020.flac I HAVE MONEY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\138279\1255-138279-0021.flac AND WE LIVE IN TWO PARISHES DO WE WHAT THEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\138279\1255-138279-0022.flac IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\138279\1255-138279-0023.flac THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\138279\1255-138279-0024.flac GOOD NIGHT FRANK GOOD NIGHT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0000.flac THINGS ARRANGE THEMSELVES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0001.flac BUT THE COUNTESS NEVER GAVE WAY AN INCH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0002.flac THE FOLLOWING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NOTE WRITTEN TO HER BY AUNT JULIA
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0003.flac I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WINE WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BEAST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0004.flac BUT THE GIRL BEGGED FOR SOME DELAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0005.flac IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQUIRED TO BE CONSIDERED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0006.flac PRIDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WEAK AS PRIDE IN THEM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0007.flac IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REFUSE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0008.flac OUR TAILOR RECEIVED HIM COURTEOUSLY HAVING LEARNED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTANDING THAT HE HAD BEHAVED WITH HONESTY AND WISDOM IN REGARD TO HIS CLIENT AND RESPECTING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORKERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECLARED THAT FOR THE LOVEL FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULARLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0009.flac THEY ARE POLES ASUNDER FROM ME HE SAID
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0010.flac BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORTUNE AND MERIT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRAVELLED FROM THE ONE POLE VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0011.flac AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAVOUR OF AN ARISTOCRACY OF BIRTH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0012.flac WHEN YOU WERE FOREMOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MASTER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0013.flac IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEGISLATIVE AND ALL HUMAN EFFORTS SHOULD AND MUST TEND
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0014.flac WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BOIL MISTER THWAITE SOME OF IT WILL PROBABLY BOIL OVER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0015.flac I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE SILK GOWNS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR ELDERS AND SO THE CONVERSATION WAS ENDED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0016.flac WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POLES MIGHT BE JOINED TOGETHER BY HER FUTURE HUSBAND
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0017.flac IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0018.flac AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MARRIED IN ALAS ME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0019.flac MUST I HAVE A PINK SILK GOWN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0020.flac I'D SOONER SEE YOU DARNING MY WORSTED STOCKINGS SWEETHEART
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0021.flac I CAN DO THAT TOO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\74899\1255-74899-0022.flac AND NOW I'LL SIT DOWN AND WRITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0000.flac HE HOPED NOTHING SERIOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRAG HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNTOWARD TIME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0001.flac BUT AS THE RAIN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CESSATION HE OBSERVED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0002.flac WHY NOT HE INQUIRED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0003.flac I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0004.flac OH BUT YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0005.flac I SHOULD THINK SO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0006.flac HE'S MY FATHER INDEED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0007.flac BUT WE HAVE BEEN TENANTS OF SYLVANIA CASTLE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEASON
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0008.flac MY FATHER'S IS A COMPARATIVELY HUMBLE RESIDENCE HARD BY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0009.flac BUT HE COULD AFFORD A MUCH BIGGER ONE IF HE CHOSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0010.flac YOU HAVE HEARD SO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0011.flac I DON'T KNOW HE DOESN'T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS AFFAIRS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0012.flac MY FATHER SHE BURST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SCOLDING ME FOR MY EXTRAVAGANCE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0013.flac WAS THAT THIS EVENING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0014.flac AND THERE ON THE NETS THEY SAT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0015.flac JOCELYN THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THROWN BY FATE INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MONTAGUES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAPULETS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0016.flac NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LODGING IN BUDMOUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0017.flac IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE STATION WHERE YOU WON'T CARE TO STAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0018.flac THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0019.flac THEY HAD NOT REALIZED THE FORCE OF THE ELEMENTS TILL NOW
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0020.flac HE STEADIED HER BODILY BY ENCIRCLING HER WAIST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECTION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0021.flac HE PITIED HER AND WHILE HE WONDERED AT IT ADMIRED HER DETERMINATION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0022.flac THEIR APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION LED TO THE WITHDRAWAL OF A BOLT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE GASLIGHT OF THE PASSAGE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0023.flac HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIGURE QUITE AS TALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BLOOM OF YOUNG WOMANHOOD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0024.flac I WILL TELL THE SERVANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0025.flac HE FELT RAVENOUSLY HUNGRY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DRYING HIS CLOTHES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EATING AT THE SAME TIME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0026.flac BY THE AID OF SOME TEMPORARY WRAPS AND SOME SLIPPERS FROM THE CUPBOARD HE WAS CONTRIVING TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORTABLE WHEN THE MAID SERVANT CAME DOWNSTAIRS WITH A DAMP ARMFUL OF WOMAN'S RAIMENT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0027.flac YOU ARE SLEEPY MY GIRL SAID PIERSTON
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0028.flac HE AGAIN BECAME CONSCIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN INITIATED DURING THE WALK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0029.flac THE WELL BELOVED WAS MOVING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WEARER OF THIS ATTIRE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90407\1255-90407-0030.flac AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AVICE CARO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0000.flac SHE DRAWS CLOSE AND SATISFIES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0001.flac HE COULD NOT FORGET MISSUS PINE AVON'S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBERED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FACIAL DETAILS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0002.flac AFTERWARDS THEY KEPT APART AWHILE IN THE DRAWING ROOM FOR FORM'S SAKE BUT EVENTUALLY GRAVITATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FINISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0003.flac BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0004.flac BUT WAS HE ABLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0005.flac IT WAS UNFAIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELLING HER EVEN THOUGH HITHERTO SUCH EXPLICITNESS HAD NOT BEEN ABSOLUTELY DEMANDED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0006.flac HE DETERMINED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INCARNATION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0007.flac SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FASHIONABLE HAMPTONSHIRE SQUARE AND HE WENT THITHER WITH EXPECTATIONS OF HAVING A HIGHLY EMOTIONAL TIME AT LEAST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0008.flac BUT SOMEHOW THE VERY BELL PULL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EARNESTLY ASKED HIM TO COME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0009.flac RAISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHTLY INQUIRING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READING SHE LEANT BACK IN THE CHAIR AS IF SOAKING HERSELF IN LUXURIOUS SENSATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GREETING WITH A FEW COMMONPLACE WORDS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0010.flac JUST AS THEY TURN MADEIRA INTO PORT IN THE SPACE OF A SINGLE NIGHT SO THIS OLD AIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTORED AND TWISTED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW POPULAR DITTY INDEED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0011.flac SHE THAWED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEWLY PAINTED AND DECORATED WITH GREENISH BLUE SATIN UP TO THE HEIGHT OF A PERSON'S HEAD AN ARRANGEMENT THAT SOMEWHAT IMPROVED HER SLIGHTLY FADED THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELPED BY THE AWNINGS OVER THE WINDOWS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0012.flac YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSERVED COMPLACENTLY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0013.flac DON'T YOU FEEL LONELY IN IT SOMETIMES O NEVER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0014.flac WHAT AN UNCIVIL THING TO SAY SHE MURMURED IN SURPRISE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0015.flac IT IS RATHER UNCIVIL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0016.flac AS A PUNISHMENT SHE DID NOT RING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0017.flac I SAW HIM AT LADY CHANNELCLIFFE'S THE OTHER NIGHT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0018.flac JOCELYN PIERSTON
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0019.flac O DIDN'T HE MARRY HER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0020.flac SAID MISSUS PINE AVON WITH A START
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0021.flac BUT JOCELYN WAS RECEDING FROM THE PRETTY WIDOW'S HOUSE WITH LONG STRIDES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0022.flac LADY IRIS HAD LEFT THE DRAWING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DINING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOWN IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LAMPLIGHT NICHOLA PINE AVON
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0023.flac SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRIVAL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0024.flac AS THE OTHER GUESTS DROPPED IN THE PAIR RETREATED INTO A SHADY CORNER AND SHE TALKED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVED OFF FOR THE EATING AND DRINKING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0025.flac HE HAD NOT BEEN APPOINTED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DINING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACTLY OPPOSITE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0026.flac THE SPRING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ARTISTIC COMMENDATION SHE DESERVED AND CRAVED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0027.flac THE LADY ON JOCELYN'S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUSTICE OF APPEAL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALKING TO HER COMPANION ON THE OUTER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1255\90413\1255-90413-0028.flac IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER'S FORMER WORKMEN AND WAS CONCERNING HER SON WHOM SHE BEGGED JOCELYN TO RECOMMEND AS CANDIDATE FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISHED HIM TO FILL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0000.flac WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLETENESS OF THE STORY AT THIS STAGE IS NOT TO RECAPITULATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LOOSE ENDS OF THREADS WOVEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMPREHENSIVE PICTURE OF EVENTS CAN BE SEEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0001.flac THE WAY OF THE INVENTOR IS HARD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0002.flac HE CAN SOMETIMES RAISE CAPITAL TO HELP HIM IN WORKING OUT HIS CRUDE CONCEPTIONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FREQUENTLY DONE AT A DISTRESSFUL COST OF PERSONAL SURRENDER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0003.flac WHEN THE RESULT IS ACHIEVED THE INVENTION MAKES ITS APPEAL ON THE SCORE OF ECONOMY OF MATERIAL OR OF EFFORT AND THEN LABOR OFTEN AWAITS WITH CRUSHING AND TYRANNICAL SPIRIT TO SMASH THE APPARATUS OR FORBID ITS VERY USE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0004.flac POSSIBLY OUR NATIONAL OPTIMISM AS REVEALED IN INVENTION THE SEEKING A HIGHER GOOD NEEDS SOME CHECK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0005.flac POSSIBLY THE LEADERS WOULD TRAVEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECTION IF CONSERVATISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SALUTARY PART IN INSISTING THAT THE PROCESSION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0006.flac ON THE CONTRARY THE CONDITIONS FOR ITS ACCEPTANCE HAD BEEN RIPENING FAST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0007.flac YET THE VERY VOGUE OF THE ELECTRIC ARC LIGHT MADE HARDER THE ARRIVAL OF THE INCANDESCENT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0008.flac A NUMBER OF PARENT ARC LIGHTING COMPANIES WERE IN EXISTENCE AND A GREAT MANY LOCAL COMPANIES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FRANCHISES FOR COMMERCIAL BUSINESS AND TO EXECUTE REGULAR CITY CONTRACTS FOR STREET LIGHTING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0009.flac THUS IN A CURIOUS MANNER THE MODERN ART OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIVIDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INTENSE RIVALRIES AND JEALOUSIES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEMPORARY AND OCCURRED IN A FIELD WHERE ULTIMATE UNION OF FORCES WAS INEVITABLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0010.flac HENCE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST EDISON STATIONS WERE ESTABLISHED THE METHODS THEY INVOLVED COULD BE FAIRLY CREDITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIXTY SEVEN PER CENT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0011.flac IT WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD THAT UNDER THESE CONDITIONS THE MODERN LIGHTING COMPANY SUPPLIES TO ITS CUSTOMERS BOTH INCANDESCENT AND ARC LIGHTING FREQUENTLY FROM THE SAME DYNAMO ELECTRIC MACHINERY AS A SOURCE OF CURRENT AND THAT THE OLD FEUD AS BETWEEN THE RIVAL SYSTEMS HAS DIED OUT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0012.flac IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE PRESIDENTS OF THE NATIONAL ELECTRIC LIGHT ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN CHOSEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY FROM AMONG THE MANAGERS OF THE GREAT EDISON LIGHTING COMPANIES IN THE LEADING CITIES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0013.flac THE OTHER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THE INCANDESCENT LIGHT CAME FROM THE GAS INDUSTRY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0014.flac THERE ALSO THE MOST BITTER FEELING WAS SHOWN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0015.flac THE GAS MANAGER DID NOT LIKE THE ARC LIGHT BUT IT INTERFERED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERVICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGEST SOURCE OF INCOME BY ANY MEANS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0016.flac HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN A MOST CONVINCING DEMONSTRATION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADDITION TO THE RESOURCES OF MANKIND ALWAYS CARRIES WITH IT UNSUSPECTED BENEFITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEMIES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0017.flac THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UNIVERSALLY THE SPIRIT SHOWN AND TO DAY IN HUNDREDS OF CITIES THE ELECTRIC AND GAS PROPERTIES ARE UNITED UNDER THE ONE MANAGEMENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO PUSH IN A FRIENDLY AND PROGRESSIVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILLUMINANTS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0018.flac THE MOST CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLE OF THIS IDENTITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW YORK ITSELF
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0019.flac SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPPOSITION OF WHICH THERE WAS PLENTY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\1585\131718\1585-131718-0020.flac BUT IT MAY BE QUESTIONED WHETHER INERTIA IS NOT EQUALLY TO BE DREADED WITH ACTIVE ILL WILL

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172182\3660-172182-0034.flac AND HE SAID TO GERAINT I AM A FEEBLE AND AN AGED MAN AND WHILST I WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE DOMINION FOR THEE AND FOR MYSELF I DID SO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172182\3660-172182-0035.flac AND EVERY ONE ASKED THAT WHICH HE DESIRED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172182\3660-172182-0036.flac AND THEY WERE NOT LONG IN GIVING SO EAGER WAS EVERY ONE TO BESTOW GIFTS AND OF THOSE WHO CAME TO ASK GIFTS NONE DEPARTED UNSATISFIED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172182\3660-172182-0037.flac THEN GERAINT SENT AMBASSADORS TO THE MEN OF CORNWALL TO ASK THEM THIS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172182\3660-172182-0038.flac AND THEY ALL SAID THAT IT WOULD BE THE FULNESS OF JOY AND HONOR TO THEM FOR GERAINT TO COME AND RECEIVE THEIR HOMAGE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172182\3660-172182-0039.flac SO HE RECEIVED THE HOMAGE OF SUCH AS WERE THERE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172182\3660-172182-0040.flac AND THE DAY AFTER THE FOLLOWERS OF ARTHUR INTENDED TO GO AWAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172183\3660-172183-0000.flac GERAINT AS HE HAD BEEN USED TO DO WHEN HE WAS AT ARTHUR'S COURT FREQUENTED TOURNAMENTS

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172183\3660-172183-0004.flac AND THE TEARS SHE SHED AND THE WORDS SHE HAD SPOKEN AWOKE HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172183\3660-172183-0005.flac AND EVIL BETIDE ME SAID HE IF THOU RETURNEST HERE UNTIL THOU KNOWEST WHETHER I HAVE LOST MY STRENGTH SO COMPLETELY AS THOU DIDST SAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172183\3660-172183-0006.flac THEN GERAINT WENT TO SEE ERBIN

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172183\3660-172183-0018.flac AND WHEN SHE SAW THE DAWN OF DAY APPEAR SHE LOOKED AROUND HER TO SEE IF HE WERE WAKING AND THEREUPON HE WOKE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172183\3660-172183-0019.flac AND THEY LEFT THE WOOD AND THEY CAME TO AN OPEN COUNTRY WITH MEADOWS ON ONE HAND AND MOWERS MOWING THE MEADOWS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172183\3660-172183-0020.flac MY LORD HE ADDED WILL IT BE DISPLEASING TO THEE IF I ASK WHENCE THOU COMEST ALSO

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172183\3660-172183-0022.flac WHAT SORT OF MEAL HE INQUIRED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172183\3660-172183-0023.flac THEN THEY WASHED AND TOOK THEIR REPAST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\172183\3660-172183-0024.flac I GO NOW LORD SAID HE TO MEET THE KNIGHT AND TO CONDUCT HIM TO HIS LODGING

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0000.flac THE DATES SEEM UNIMPORTANT BUT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD THE OFFICERS AND MEN OF THE SHIP HAVE BEEN UNREMITTINGLY BUSY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0001.flac BOWERS ATTACKED THE SHIP'S STORES SURVEYED RELISTED AND RESTOWED THEM SAVING VERY MUCH SPACE BY UNSTOWING NUMEROUS CASES AND STOWING THE CONTENTS IN THE LAZARETTE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0002.flac WITHOUT STEAM THE LEAK CAN NOW BE KEPT UNDER WITH THE HAND PUMP BY TWO DAILY EFFORTS OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR TO TWENTY MINUTES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0003.flac AS THE SHIP WAS AND IN HER PRESENT HEAVILY LADEN CONDITION IT WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE TAKEN THREE TO FOUR HOURS EACH DAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0004.flac THE LARGE GREEN TENT WAS PUT UP AND PROPER SUPPORTS MADE FOR IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0005.flac THE ENGINE ROOM STAFF AND ANDERSON'S PEOPLE ON THE ENGINES SCIENTISTS WERE STOWING THEIR LABORATORIES THE COOK REFITTING HIS GALLEY AND SO FORTH NOT A SINGLE SPOT BUT HAD ITS BAND OF WORKERS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0006.flac THE MEN'S SPACE SUCH AS IT IS THEREFORE EXTENDS FROM THE FORE HATCH TO THE STEM ON THE MAIN DECK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0007.flac UNDER THE FORECASTLE ARE STALLS FOR FIFTEEN PONIES THE MAXIMUM THE SPACE WOULD HOLD THE NARROW IRREGULAR SPACE IN FRONT IS PACKED TIGHT WITH FODDER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0008.flac IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FORECASTLE BULKHEAD IS THE SMALL BOOBY HATCH THE ONLY ENTRANCE TO THE MEN'S MESS DECK IN BAD WEATHER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0009.flac ABAFT THE FORE HATCH IS THE ICE HOUSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0010.flac WE MANAGED TO GET THREE TONS OF ICE ONE HUNDRED SIXTY TWO CARCASES OF MUTTON AND THREE CARCASES OF BEEF BESIDES SOME BOXES OF SWEETBREADS AND KIDNEYS INTO THIS SPACE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0011.flac THE SACKS CONTAINING THIS LAST ADDED TO THE GOODS ALREADY MENTIONED MAKE A REALLY HEAVY DECK CARGO AND ONE IS NATURALLY ANXIOUS CONCERNING IT BUT EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE DONE BY LASHING AND SECURING HAS BEEN DONE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0012.flac FORAGE I ORIGINALLY ORDERED THIRTY TONS OF COMPRESSED OATEN HAY FROM MELBOURNE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0013.flac THE SCENE IS WHOLLY ENCHANTING AND SUCH A VIEW FROM SOME SHELTERED SUNNY CORNER IN A GARDEN WHICH BLAZES WITH MASSES OF RED AND GOLDEN FLOWERS TENDS TO FEELINGS OF INEXPRESSIBLE SATISFACTION WITH ALL THINGS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0014.flac A GREAT MASS OF PEOPLE ASSEMBLED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0015.flac K AND I LUNCHED WITH A PARTY IN THE NEW ZEALAND COMPANY'S SHIP RUAPEHU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0016.flac TELEGRAM TO SAY TERRA NOVA HAD ARRIVED SUNDAY NIGHT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0017.flac A THIRD SLEDGE STANDS ACROSS THE BREAK OF THE POOP IN THE SPACE HITHERTO OCCUPIED BY THE AFTER WINCH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0018.flac THE QUANTITY IS TWO AND A HALF TONS AND THE SPACE OCCUPIED CONSIDERABLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0019.flac THE SHIP WAS OVER TWO FEET BY THE STERN BUT THIS WILL SOON BE REMEDIED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0020.flac THEY MUST PERFORCE BE CHAINED UP AND THEY ARE GIVEN WHAT SHELTER IS AFFORDED ON DECK BUT THEIR POSITION IS NOT ENVIABLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0021.flac IT IS A PATHETIC ATTITUDE DEEPLY SIGNIFICANT OF COLD AND MISERY OCCASIONALLY SOME POOR BEAST EMITS A LONG PATHETIC WHINE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0022.flac THERE ARE GENERALLY ONE OR TWO ON WATCH WHICH EASES MATTERS BUT IT IS A SQUASH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0023.flac LATER IN THE DAY THE WIND HAS VEERED TO THE WESTWARD HEADING US SLIGHTLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0024.flac OATES AND ATKINSON WITH INTERMITTENT ASSISTANCE FROM OTHERS WERE BUSY KEEPING THE PONIES ON THEIR LEGS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0025.flac THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO GRAPPLE WITH THE EVIL AND NEARLY ALL HANDS WERE LABOURING FOR HOURS IN THE WAIST OF THE SHIP HEAVING COAL SACKS OVERBOARD AND RE LASHING THE PETROL CASES ET CETERA IN THE BEST MANNER POSSIBLE UNDER SUCH DIFFICULT AND DANGEROUS CIRCUMSTANCES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0026.flac NO SOONER WAS SOME SEMBLANCE OF ORDER RESTORED THAN SOME EXCEPTIONALLY HEAVY WAVE WOULD TEAR AWAY THE LASHING AND THE WORK HAD TO BE DONE ALL OVER AGAIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0027.flac FROM THIS MOMENT ABOUT FOUR A M THE ENGINE ROOM BECAME THE CENTRE OF INTEREST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0028.flac THE WATER GAINED IN SPITE OF EVERY EFFORT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0029.flac THE OUTLOOK APPEARED GRIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0030.flac THE AMOUNT OF WATER WHICH WAS BEING MADE WITH THE SHIP SO ROUGHLY HANDLED WAS MOST UNCERTAIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0031.flac WILLIAMS HAD TO CONFESS HE WAS BEATEN AND MUST DRAW FIRES WHAT WAS TO BE DONE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0032.flac THE BILGE PUMP IS DEPENDENT ON THE MAIN ENGINE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0033.flac ON ONE OCCASION I WAS WAIST DEEP WHEN STANDING ON THE RAIL OF THE POOP
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0034.flac THE AFTERGUARD WERE ORGANISED IN TWO PARTIES BY EVANS TO WORK BUCKETS THE MEN WERE KEPT STEADILY GOING ON THE CHOKED HAND PUMPS THIS SEEMED ALL THAT COULD BE DONE FOR THE MOMENT AND WHAT A MEASURE TO COUNT AS THE SOLE SAFEGUARD OF THE SHIP FROM SINKING PRACTICALLY AN ATTEMPT TO BALE HER OUT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3660\6517\3660-6517-0035.flac OCCASIONALLY A HEAVY SEA WOULD BEAR ONE OF THEM AWAY AND HE WAS ONLY SAVED BY HIS CHAIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172005\3663-172005-0000.flac THE FAWN HAD TAKEN HIS MORNING MEAL AND NOW LAY CURLED UP ON A BED OF MOSS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172005\3663-172005-0001.flac WHENEVER THE FAWN CAUGHT UP HE WAS QUITE CONTENT TO FRISK ABOUT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172005\3663-172005-0002.flac THE DANGER WAS CERTAIN NOW IT WAS NEAR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172005\3663-172005-0003.flac THE HOUNDS HAD STRUCK HER TRAIL WHERE SHE TURNED AND THE FAWN WAS SAFE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172005\3663-172005-0004.flac ONE WAS ROWING THE OTHER HAD A GUN IN HIS HAND WHAT SHOULD SHE DO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172005\3663-172005-0005.flac HER TIRED LEGS COULD NOT PROPEL THE TIRED BODY RAPIDLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172005\3663-172005-0006.flac THE DOE SAW THE BOAT NEARING HER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172005\3663-172005-0007.flac IN A MOMENT MORE THE BOAT WAS ON HER AND THE MAN AT THE OARS HAD LEANED OVER AND CAUGHT HER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0000.flac I WAS TORMENTED BY THIRST BUT HAD ABSTAINED FROM DRINKING FOR MANY DAYS ACCORDING TO THE DOCTORS ORDERS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0001.flac THAT OLD MAN CEASED TO GIVE SO MUCH ANNOYANCE YET SOMETIMES HE APPEARED TO ME IN DREAMS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0002.flac FELICE HAD GIVEN THEM ORDERS NOT TO SPEAK TO ME OF THIS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0003.flac THIS MAID HAD STOLEN FROM ME CERTAIN LITTLE THINGS OF SOME IMPORTANCE AND IN HER FEAR OF BEING DETECTED SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY GLAD IF I HAD DIED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0004.flac ACCORDINGLY SHE ALLOWED ME TWICE TO TAKE AS MUCH AS I COULD OF THE WATER SO THAT IN GOOD EARNEST I SWALLOWED MORE THAN A FLASK FULL ONE I THEN COVERED MYSELF AND BEGAN TO SWEAT AND FELL INTO A DEEP SLEEP
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0005.flac THEY SAY THAT MY POOR FRIEND WAS ON THE POINT OF FALLING TO THE GROUND SO GRIEVED WAS HE TO HEAR THIS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0006.flac AFTERWARDS HE TOOK AN UGLY STICK AND BEGAN TO BEAT THE SERVING GIRL WITH ALL HIS MIGHT SHOUTING OUT AH TRAITRESS YOU HAVE KILLED HIM FOR ME THEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0007.flac SHE MAY INDEED HAVE SAVED MY LIFE SO LEND ME A HELPING HAND FOR I HAVE SWEATED AND BE QUICK ABOUT IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0008.flac FELICE RECOVERED HIS SPIRITS DRIED AND MADE ME COMFORTABLE AND I BEING CONSCIOUS OF A GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN MY STATE BEGAN TO RECKON ON RECOVERY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0009.flac JUST THEN THE OTHER DOCTOR BERNARDINO PUT IN HIS APPEARANCE WHO AT THE BEGINNING OF MY ILLNESS HAD REFUSED TO BLEED ME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0010.flac MAESTRO FRANCESCO THAT MOST ABLE MAN EXCLAIMED OH POWER OF NATURE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0011.flac SHE KNOWS WHAT SHE REQUIRES AND THE PHYSICIANS KNOW NOTHING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0012.flac THAT SIMPLETON MAESTRO BERNARDINO MADE ANSWER SAYING IF HE HAD DRUNK ANOTHER BOTTLE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CURED UPON THE SPOT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0013.flac AFTERWARDS HE TURNED TO ME AND ASKED IF I COULD HAVE DRUNK MORE WATER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0014.flac I ANSWERED NO BECAUSE I HAD ENTIRELY QUENCHED MY THIRST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0015.flac IN LIKE MANNER SHE WAS ASKING FOR WHAT SHE WANTED WHEN THE POOR YOUNG MAN BEGGED YOU TO BLEED HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0016.flac IF YOU KNEW THAT HIS RECOVERY DEPENDED UPON HIS DRINKING TWO FLASKS OF WATER WHY DID YOU NOT SAY SO BEFORE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0017.flac YOU MIGHT THEN HAVE BOASTED OF HIS CURE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0018.flac AT THESE WORDS THE WRETCHED QUACK SULKILY DEPARTED AND NEVER SHOWED HIS FACE AGAIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0019.flac THE VERY EVENING I WAS TAKEN WITH GREAT PRECAUTIONS IN A CHAIR WELL WRAPPED UP AND PROTECTED FROM THE COLD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0020.flac DO NOT PERMIT HIM ANY IRREGULARITIES FOR THOUGH HE HAS ESCAPED THIS TIME ANOTHER DISORDER NOW WOULD BE THE DEATH OF HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0021.flac THEN HE TURNED TO ME AND SAID MY BENVENUTO BE PRUDENT COMMIT NO EXCESSES AND WHEN YOU ARE QUITE RECOVERED I BEG YOU TO MAKE ME A MADONNA WITH YOUR OWN HAND AND I WILL ALWAYS PAY MY DEVOTIONS TO IT FOR YOUR SAKE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0022.flac SO I MADE MY MIND UP AND PREPARED TO TRAVEL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0023.flac THAT DAY MANY FRIENDS CAME TO SEE ME AMONG OTHERS PIER LANDI WHO WAS THE BEST AND DEAREST FRIEND I EVER HAD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0024.flac NEXT DAY THERE CAME A CERTAIN NICCOLO DA MONTE AGUTO WHO WAS ALSO A VERY GREAT FRIEND OF MINE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0025.flac I HAD HARBOURED HIM IN ROME AND PROVIDED FOR HIS COSTS WHILE HE HAD TURNED MY WHOLE HOUSE UPSIDE DOWN FOR THE MAN WAS SUBJECT TO A SPECIES OF DRY SCAB WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS IN THE HABIT OF SCRATCHING WITH HIS HANDS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0026.flac MEANWHILE THAT ABLE PHYSICIAN FRANCESCO DA MONTE VARCHI ATTENDED TO MY CURE WITH GREAT SKILL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0027.flac THERE THEY SEATED ME TO WAIT UNTIL THE DUKE WENT BY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0028.flac MANY OF MY FRIENDS AT COURT CAME UP TO GREET ME AND EXPRESSED SURPRISE THAT I HAD UNDERGONE THE INCONVENIENCE OF BEING CARRIED IN THAT WAY WHILE SO SHATTERED BY ILLNESS THEY SAID THAT I OUGHT TO HAVE WAITED TILL I WAS WELL AND THEN TO HAVE VISITED THE DUKE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\3663\172528\3663-172528-0029.flac AT THESE WORDS MAESTRO AGOSTINO THE DUKES TAILOR MADE HIS WAY THROUGH ALL THOSE GENTLEMEN AND SAID IF THAT IS ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW YOU SHALL KNOW IT AT THIS VERY MOMENT

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\13259\4323-13259-0007.flac WHEN HAD THE FIRST CHURCH YIELDED TO SUCH A BAPTISM OF TEARS

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\13259\4323-13259-0010.flac THE MEETING WAS TENDER IT GLOWED WITH THE SPIRIT'S PRESENCE IT WAS ALIVE WITH STRONG AND LASTING RESOLVE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHISKEY POWER IN RAYMOND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS REIGN FOREVER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\13259\4323-13259-0011.flac SINCE THE FIRST SUNDAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VOLUNTEERS HAD PLEDGED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JESUS WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEETINGS HAD BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY DISTINCT IMPULSES OR IMPRESSIONS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\13259\4323-13259-0012.flac AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SALOON AND ITS AWFUL CURSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\13259\4323-13259-0013.flac GRAY AND HIS WIFE WERE BESIEGED BY INQUIRERS WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LOREEN'S FRIENDS AND ACQUAINTANCES WERE EXPECTED TO DO IN PAYING THEIR LAST RESPECTS TO HER

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\13259\4323-13259-0019.flac IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTERNOON A SOMEWHAT NOTED NEWSPAPER CORRESPONDENT WAS PASSING THROUGH RAYMOND ON HIS WAY TO AN EDITORIAL CONVENTION IN A NEIGHBORING CITY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\13259\4323-13259-0020.flac SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DRUNKARD AND YET THE SERVICES AT THE TENT WERE AS IMPRESSIVE AS ANY I EVER WITNESSED IN A METROPOLITAN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DISTINGUISHED CITIZEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\13259\4323-13259-0021.flac IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGER IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDERABLE ASTONISHMENT TO HEAR VOICES LIKE THOSE ONE NATURALLY EXPECTS TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCHES OR CONCERTS AT SUCH A MEETING AS THIS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\13259\4323-13259-0022.flac MISTER MAXWELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULLY PREPARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PECULIARLY SENSITIVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LIQUOR BUSINESS ON THE LIVES OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\13259\4323-13259-0023.flac RAYMOND OF COURSE BEING A RAILROAD TOWN AND THE CENTRE OF THE GREAT PACKING INTERESTS FOR THIS REGION IS FULL OF SALOONS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\13259\4323-13259-0024.flac THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QUEER PART OF THIS STRANGE SERVICE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\13259\4323-13259-0025.flac IT WAS ONE OF THE SIMPLEST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMPRESSIVE SIGHTS I EVER WITNESSED

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0000.flac THE NEXT MOMENT HE FELL BACK IN AMAZEMENT BEFORE THE IMPETUOUS RUSH OF A STARRY EYED FLUSHED CHEEKED YOUNG WOMAN WHO DEMANDED

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0009.flac BILLY TURNED EAGERLY BUT BEFORE SHE COULD TAKE SO MUCH AS ONE STEP TOWARD THE DOOR AT THE END OF THE HALL AUNT HANNAH'S INDIGNANT VOICE ARRESTED HER BILLY STOP
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0010.flac PETE GO TELL YOUR MASTER THAT WE ARE HERE AND ASK IF HE WILL RECEIVE US PETE'S LIPS TWITCHED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0011.flac BUT HIS FACE WAS PRETERNATURALLY GRAVE WHEN HE SPOKE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0012.flac A FLYING FIGURE BRUSHED BY HIM AND FELL ON ITS KNEES BY THE COUCH WITH A LOW CRY BERTRAM'S EYES FLEW OPEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0013.flac DONG LING FOUND HIM THERE A MINUTE LATER POLISHING A SILVER TEASPOON WITH A FRINGED NAPKIN THAT HAD BEEN SPREAD OVER BERTRAM'S TRAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0014.flac IN THE HALL ABOVE AUNT HANNAH WAS CRYING INTO WILLIAM'S GRAY LINEN DUSTER THAT HUNG ON THE HALL RACK AUNT HANNAH'S HANDKERCHIEF WAS ON THE FLOOR BACK AT HILLSIDE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0015.flac THEN VERY GRADUALLY IT DAWNED OVER THEM THAT THERE WAS AFTER ALL SOMETHING STRANGE AND UNEXPLAINED IN IT ALL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0016.flac AS IF TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE WAS HERE LIKE THIS HE DREW HER EVEN CLOSER BERTRAM WAS SO THANKFUL THAT HE DID HAVE ONE ARM THAT WAS USABLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0017.flac WHY OF OF COURSE STAMMERED BILLY I COULDN'T HELP THINKING THAT MAYBE YOU HAD FOUND OUT YOU DIDN'T WANT ME

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0020.flac SHE PULLED HERSELF HALF AWAY FROM BERTRAM'S ENCIRCLING ARM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0021.flac BILLY DREW A QUIVERING SIGH

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0023.flac WELL SHE WROTE A LETTER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0024.flac BILLY LAUGHED GAYLY BUT SHE SHIFTED HER POSITION AND DID NOT MEET HER LOVER'S EYES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0025.flac AND YOU NEVER DID THINK FOR A MINUTE BILLY THAT YOU CARED FOR HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0026.flac HE HAD NOT BEEN SLOW TO MARK THAT SWIFT LOWERING OF HER EYELIDS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0027.flac BILLY WAS SO GLAD BERTRAM HAD TURNED THE QUESTION ON HER LOVE INSTEAD OF ARKWRIGHT'S
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0028.flac AFTER A MINUTE BILLY STIRRED AND SIGHED HAPPILY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0029.flac YOU SEE I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH MISTER ARKWRIGHT

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0031.flac BILLY PUT A SOFT FINGER ON HIS LIPS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0032.flac BERTRAM KISSED THE FINGER AND SUBSIDED HUMPH HE COMMENTED

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0040.flac DON'T WANT YOU TO GET READY RETORTED BERTRAM PROMPTLY I SAW MARIE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0041.flac IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLECLOTHS AND NAPKINS AND DOILIES AND LACE RUFFLINGS WE'LL DO IT AFTERWARDS NOT BEFORE BUT

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0046.flac IT WAS AUNT HANNAH'S PLAINTIVE VOICE AT THE DOORWAY A LITTLE LATER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0047.flac WE MUST GO HOME AND WILLIAM IS HERE TOO AND WANTS TO SEE YOU

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4323\55228\4323-55228-0052.flac WE WANTED IT TO MORROW BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LICENSE LAW
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0000.flac YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONTEMPLATING A LARGE FORTUNE THAT IN DESPITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN EAGER EXPECTATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0001.flac A PART OF THAT IMPRESSION WAS DUE TO THE ENGAGEMENT WHICH HE MUST NOW FULFIL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0002.flac TO SHUFFLE OUT OF THIS DUTY WOULD MAKE HIM TOO IGNOBLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0003.flac BECAUSE IN HIS SALAD DAYS HE DALLIED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHARMS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESSITY OF SACRIFICING HIS PROSPECTS TO THAT RAW ATTACHMENT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0004.flac UNABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WANDERED GLOOMILY ABOUT REGENT'S PARK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0005.flac HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DESTINY AND THEREFORE BY MARIAN WHO WAS FATE'S INSTRUMENT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0006.flac HE WROTE TO MARIAN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0007.flac WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME AND SEE ME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0008.flac I SCARCELY THOUGHT OF BIFFEN AS LIKELY TO KILL HIMSELF
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0009.flac BUT WHY THE DEUCE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0010.flac I HOPED YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0011.flac POVERTY I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0012.flac BUT I WILL SEE WHELPDALE I HADN'T COME ACROSS BIFFEN FOR A LONG TIME

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0014.flac ASKED AMY COMPASSIONATELY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0015.flac I'M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FAILED UTTERLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0016.flac OH IF I HAD IMAGINED HIM STILL IN SUCH DISTRESS SURELY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0017.flac PERCHANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT HOPELESS LOVE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0018.flac HE SENT ME A COPY OF HIS NOVEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TWICE AFTER THAT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0019.flac HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERSE UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EASE THAN COULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0020.flac AMY MIGHT TAKE A FOREMOST PLACE AMONG BRILLIANT WOMEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0021.flac ESPECIALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THREATENED WITH BLINDNESS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0022.flac IS IT SO SERIOUS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0023.flac EVEN IF MISTER YULE RECOVERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKELY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0024.flac OUR DIFFICULTIES ARE SO GRAVE THAT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0025.flac HE PAUSED AND LET HIS HAND FAIL DESPONDENTLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0026.flac I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY ACHIEVE

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0028.flac THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFERENCE IN MY POSITION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0029.flac RECALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0030.flac JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0032.flac DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CURRENT AND SO ON GENERALLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0033.flac SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DETECTED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGNATURE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0034.flac HER STORY IN THAT GIRLS PAPER HAS ATTRACTED ATTENTION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0035.flac AND I COULD SO EASILY PUT HER AT REST BY RENOUNCING ALL CLAIM UPON HER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0036.flac I SURMISE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DECISION

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0042.flac YET FOR SUCH FEELINGS HE REPROACHED HIMSELF AND THE REPROACH MADE HIM ANGRY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0043.flac MARIAN COULD NOT MISTAKE THE AIR OF RESTLESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPANION'S SMOOTH COUNTENANCE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0044.flac SHE HAD DIVINED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRAVE REASON FOR THIS SUMMONS AND THE PANTING WITH WHICH SHE HAD APPROACHED WAS HALF CAUSED BY THE ANXIOUS BEATS OF HER HEART
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0045.flac HE BEGAN ABRUPTLY

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0056.flac I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEALTH JASPER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0057.flac SHE PAUSED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOUCHINGLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0058.flac DEAR I CAN'T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUTY TO RENOUNCE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BLIND
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0059.flac HAS ONE THING OCCURRED TO YOU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0060.flac WILL HE CONSENT TO RECEIVE AN ALLOWANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MILVAIN

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0062.flac SHE LISTENED ANXIOUSLY AND REFLECTED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0063.flac AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS THE VERY SERIOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU ARE MY WIFE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0064.flac IT ISN'T YOUR FAULT MARIAN AND WELL THEN THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0065.flac EXCEPT JASPER THAT IF FATHER IS HELPLESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASSURING HIS SUPPORT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0066.flac DO YOU THINK THEM INSURMOUNTABLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0067.flac THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DECIDED IS IMPOSSIBLE MARIAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0077.flac I DO WISH IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0078.flac HER EMOTION HAD AN EFFECT UPON HIM AND HIS VOICE TREMBLED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0079.flac THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SURRENDER EVERYTHING FOR HER PARENTS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0080.flac YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN'T YOU ADVISE ME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0081.flac IS THERE NO WAY OF PROVIDING FOR MY FATHER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0082.flac GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHTFUL MARIAN I CAN'T STAND IT

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0084.flac HE HAD MADE A PRETENCE OF HOLDING HIS UMBRELLA OVER HER BUT MARIAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENEATH THE SHELTER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AVERTED FROM HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0085.flac MOVING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FRAME WAS SHAKEN BY SOUNDLESS SOBBING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0086.flac IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELFISHNESS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0087.flac BUT I COULDN'T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INVITE SUCH MISERY AS THIS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0088.flac YOU DON'T LOVE ME JASPER AND THAT'S AN END OF EVERYTHING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0089.flac HAPPINESS OR MISERY COME TO US BY FATE

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0095.flac SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD THOROUGHLY DESPISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MERITED MY PERVERSE PRIDE WOULD REVOLT AGAINST IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0096.flac WHAT CAN BE SIMPLER THAN THE TRUTH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0097.flac IT IS A THING THAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HONOUR DEMANDS IS THE COURAGE TO CONFESS THE TRUTH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0098.flac MARIAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENGAGEMENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTHS BUT WITHOUT OUR MEETING DURING THAT TIME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0099.flac THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILDISH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0100.flac THE RAIN FELL UNCEASINGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MINGLE AN AUTUMNAL MIST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0101.flac JASPER DELAYED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CALMLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0102.flac ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUSEUM YES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0103.flac GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MARIAN YOU CAN'T WORK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0104.flac I MUST AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LOSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0105.flac GOOD BYE SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0106.flac THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INSTANT THEN MARIAN LEFT THE SHELTER OF THE TREE OPENED HER UMBRELLA AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0107.flac JASPER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFFERING A SEVERE HUMILIATION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0108.flac HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECOGNISED GENUINE SUFFERING IN HIS TONES AND ASPECT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0109.flac A FEW WEEKS AGO HE ACTUALLY PROPOSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRETEND TO HAVE THE SLIGHTEST AFFECTION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKELY TO BE FOOLISH ENOUGH TO MARRY HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0110.flac YESTERDAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FINAL ANSWER A REFUSAL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0111.flac YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURELY YOU NEED NO FRESH PROOF HOW UTTERLY UNWORTHY HE IS OF YOU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0112.flac YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SEX AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LOSE YOU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0113.flac SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REPLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4515\11057\4515-11057-0114.flac I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WRITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REFERENCE TO THESE TROUBLES TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\102353\4570-102353-0000.flac WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE AND ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTERIOR OF THE CONTINENT WHICH WAS REQUISITE FOR A DETERMINATION OF THE PROBLEM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\102353\4570-102353-0001.flac SEVERAL DIFFERENT PARTIES WERE THEREFORE ORGANIZED TO EXAMINE THE VARIOUS ROUTES SUPPOSED TO BE PRACTICABLE WITHIN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN LIMITS OF THE UNITED STATES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\102353\4570-102353-0002.flac THE ONLY DISCRIMINATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROMPT AND THOROUGH EQUIPMENT OF THE PARTIES FOR THE EXTREME NORTHERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE MOST DIFFICULT OF EXECUTION OF ALL THE SURVEYS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\102353\4570-102353-0003.flac INQUIRIES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GUNPOWDER WHICH SUBSEQUENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A COARSER GRAIN FOR ARTILLERY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\102353\4570-102353-0004.flac THE OFFICERS OF THESE REGIMENTS WERE CHOSEN PARTLY BY SELECTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERVICE IN THE REGULAR ARMY AND PARTLY BY APPOINTMENT FROM CIVIL LIFE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\102353\4570-102353-0005.flac UNDER INSTRUCTIONS FROM THE PRESIDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REVISED AND MODIFIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS NEW ELEMENT OF GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\102353\4570-102353-0006.flac AFTER SOME FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE QUESTION THE VISITORS WITHDREW DISSATISFIED WITH THE RESULT OF THE INTERVIEW
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\102353\4570-102353-0007.flac THE QUARTERMASTER GENERAL ON HEARING OF THIS CONVERSATION HASTENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MISTAKE THAT THE APPOINTEE TO THE OFFICE HAD BEEN CONFOUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WHIG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEMOCRAT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\102353\4570-102353-0008.flac I ASSURED THE GENERAL THAT THIS WAS ALTOGETHER IMMATERIAL ADDING THAT IT WAS A VERY PRETTY QUARREL AS IT STOOD AND THAT I HAD NO DESIRE TO EFFECT A SETTLEMENT OF IT ON ANY INFERIOR ISSUE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\14911\4570-14911-0000.flac NEVERTHELESS IN GENERAL APPEARANCE THE HARRIER AND THE FOXHOUND ARE VERY MUCH ALIKE THE ONE OBVIOUS DISTINCTION BEING THAT OF SIZE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\14911\4570-14911-0001.flac IF YOU WANT TO HUNT YOUR HARRIERS ON FOOT SIXTEEN INCHES IS QUITE BIG ENOUGH ALMOST TOO BIG TO RUN WITH BUT IF YOU ARE RIDING TO THEM TWENTY INCHES IS A USEFUL HEIGHT OR EVEN NINETEEN INCHES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\14911\4570-14911-0002.flac IT IS USELESS TO LAY DOWN ANY HARD AND FAST RULE AS TO COLOUR IT IS SO MUCH A MATTER OF INDIVIDUAL TASTE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\14911\4570-14911-0003.flac BUT PUPPIES ARE USUALLY SENT OUT TO WALK AND MAY EASILY BE PROCURED TO BE KEPT AND REARED UNTIL THEY ARE OLD ENOUGH TO BE ENTERED TO THEIR WORK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\14911\4570-14911-0004.flac HE IS OF COURSE FINER BUT WITH THE LENGTH OF NECK SO PERFECT IN THE BIGGER HOUND THE LITTLE SHOULDERS OF THE SAME PATTERN AND THE TYPICAL QUARTERS AND SECOND THIGHS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\14911\4570-14911-0005.flac AND WHEN HE IS FAIRLY ON A LINE OF COURSE HE STICKS TO IT AS THE SAYING IS LIKE A BEAGLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\14911\4570-14911-0006.flac IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THEREFORE THAT THE BEAGLE WAS CROSSED WITH THE WELSH SOUTHERN OR OTTERHOUND TO GET MORE SIZE AND POWER AS THERE CERTAINLY WAS A WELSH ROUGH COATED BEAGLE OF GOOD EIGHTEEN INCHES AND AN ALMOST IDENTICAL CONTEMPORARY THAT WAS CALLED THE ESSEX BEAGLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\14911\4570-14911-0007.flac THAT A GREAT MANY OF THE TRUE ORDER WERE BRED BECAME VERY MANIFEST AS SOON AS THE HARRIER AND BEAGLE ASSOCIATION WAS FORMED AND MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN A SECTION OF THE PETERBOROUGH HOUND SHOW WAS RESERVED FOR THEM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\4570\14911\4570-14911-0008.flac THEN THEY SEEMED TO SPRING FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50873\5849-50873-0037.flac THE TREE IN WHICH THE DOCUMENT WAS HIDDEN WAS EVER AFTERWARD KNOWN AS THE CHARTER OAK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50873\5849-50873-0038.flac IT REMAINED VIGOROUS BEARING FRUIT EVERY YEAR UNTIL A LITTLE AFTER MIDNIGHT AUGUST EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX WHEN IT WAS PROSTRATED BY A HEAVY STORM OF WIND

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50873\5849-50873-0041.flac FROM THAT TIME UNTIL THE ENFORCED UNION OF THE COLONIES FOR MUTUAL DEFENCE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF THE FRENCH AND INDIAN WAR THE INHABITANTS OF RHODE ISLAND BORE THEIR SHARE IN THE DEFENSIVE EFFORTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THE HOSTILE SAVAGES HUNG ALONG THE FRONTIERS OF NEW YORK LIKE AN ILL OMENED CLOUD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50873\5849-50873-0042.flac THE HISTORY OF THAT COMMONWEALTH IS IDENTIFIED WITH THAT OF ALL NEW ENGLAND FROM THE BEGINNING OF KING WILLIAM'S WAR SOON AFTER TO THE EXPULSION OF ANDROS

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50962\5849-50962-0011.flac IT SEEMED A LONG TIME BEFORE ANY MOVEMENT OF THE CABLE SHOWED THAT THE BUOY WAS RETURNING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50962\5849-50962-0012.flac NEARER AND NEARER IT CAME UNTIL NOW A MAN'S HEAD COULD BE SEEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50962\5849-50962-0013.flac THE GIRLS AND WOMEN WERE TOO FRIGHTENED TO TALK AND NELLIE CLUNG CLOSE TO HER MOTHER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50962\5849-50962-0014.flac A BIG ROLLER DASHING IN FINISHED THE WORK FOR THE LIFE GUARDS AND A MAN IN THE CORK BELT BOUNDED UPON SHORE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50962\5849-50962-0015.flac EVERYBODY GATHERED AROUND AND NELLIE WITH A STRANGE FACE AND A STRANGER HOPE BROKE THROUGH THE CROWD TO SEE THE RESCUED MAN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50962\5849-50962-0016.flac OH IT IS MY FATHER SHE SCREAMED FALLING RIGHT INTO THE ARMS OF THE DRENCHED MAN

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50963\5849-50963-0000.flac A BEAUTIFUL DAY HAD GROWN OUT OF THE DREADFUL STORM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50963\5849-50963-0001.flac AND EVERYBODY WAS SO HAPPY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50963\5849-50963-0002.flac THE NEPTUNE THE VESSEL THAT HAD STRUCK ON THE SAND BAR WAS NOW SAFELY ANCHORED NEAR SHORE AND THE SAILORS CAME IN AND OUT IN ROW BOATS BACK AND FORTH TO LAND JUST AS THEY WISHED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50963\5849-50963-0003.flac THEN WE HAD TO GO BACK TO WORK AT THE LOGS WENT ON THE CAPTAIN AND THEN ONE OF OUR CREW TOOK A FEVER

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50963\5849-50963-0008.flac THE VALUE REPEATED THE CAPTAIN ASIDE SO THAT THE STRANGERS MIGHT NOT HEAR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50963\5849-50963-0009.flac WELL I'M A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MATE MC LAUGHLIN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTRACTED FOR BY THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PIANO FIRM IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DELIVERED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50963\5849-50963-0013.flac THE WONDERFUL FRESH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHTENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAINEST FACE AND THE MOST AWKWARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS NIMBLE AS AN ATHLETE FROM HIS PERFECT EXERCISE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50964\5849-50964-0000.flac I DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BY TO YOU NELLIE TOLD DOROTHY AND NAN NEXT MORNING

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50964\5849-50964-0007.flac MY UNCLE IS A FIREMAN AND HE CAN TAKE US THROUGH HIS ENGINE HOUSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50964\5849-50964-0008.flac MOST OF THEM I GUESS ANSWERED BERT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50964\5849-50964-0009.flac WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD VACATION AND I AM WILLING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50964\5849-50964-0010.flac SO AM I DECLARED NAN VACATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50964\5849-50964-0011.flac MISTER BOBBSEY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FREDDIE AND FLOSSIE WERE BUSY PACKING UP
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50964\5849-50964-0012.flac THERE WERE THE SHELLS TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NETS BESIDES DOWNY THE DUCK AND SNOOP THE CAT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\5849\50964\5849-50964-0013.flac AND SO OUR LITTLE FRIENDS HAD SPENT ALL THEIR VACATION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0000.flac HIS CHARACTERS GET DRUNK OR GO MAD WITH JEALOUSY OR FALL IN EPILEPTIC FITS OR RAVE HYSTERICALLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0001.flac IF DOSTOEVSKY HAD HAD LESS VISION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRINDBERG
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0002.flac LIKE THEM HE IS A NOVELIST OF TORTURE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0003.flac CERTAINLY THE LUST OF CRUELTY THE LUST OF DESTRUCTION FOR DESTRUCTION'S SAKE IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS OF THE DEADLY SINS IN DOSTOEVSKY'S MEN AND WOMEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0004.flac HE MAY NOT BE A CRUEL AUTHOR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0005.flac BUT THEY ARE NEVER IN BALANCE THEY ARE ALWAYS IN DEMONIACAL CONFLICT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0006.flac EVEN THE LUST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LUST OF A MORE OR LESS SANE MAN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0007.flac DOSTOEVSKY COULD NOT HAVE DESCRIBED THE SIN OF NEKHLUDOV IN RESURRECTION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0008.flac THIS IS A MADHOUSE CRIES SOME ONE IN THE IDIOT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0009.flac ONE RESULT OF THIS IS A MULTIPLICITY OF ACTION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0010.flac EVEN THE TALK IS OF ACTIONS MORE THAN OF IDEAS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0011.flac HE SOWS VIOLENT DEEDS NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SACK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0012.flac BUT ONE HAD NOTICED DURING THOSE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WEARING A SILVER WATCH ON A YELLOW BEAD CHAIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0013.flac HE TOOK A KNIFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACHED HIM CAUTIOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK AIM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVENWARDS CROSSED HIMSELF AND PRAYING FERVENTLY GOD FORGIVE ME FOR CHRIST'S SAKE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0014.flac HE NEVER PAINTS EVERYMAN HE ALWAYS PROJECTS DOSTOEVSKY OR A NIGHTMARE OF DOSTOEVSKY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0015.flac THAT IS WHY CRIME AND PUNISHMENT BELONGS TO A LOWER RANGE OF FICTION THAN ANNA KARENINA OR FATHERS AND SONS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0016.flac WE SYMPATHIZE INDEED WITH THE FEARS THE BRAVADO THE DESPAIR THAT SUCCEED THE CRIME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0017.flac HE IS A GROTESQUE MADE ALIVE BY SHEER IMAGINATIVE INTENSITY AND PASSION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0018.flac ONE DOES NOT GRUDGE AN ARTIST AN ABNORMAL CHARACTER OR TWO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0019.flac HE INVENTS VICIOUS GROTESQUES AS DICKENS INVENTS COMIC GROTESQUES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0020.flac WAS VERY FOND OF HANGING CATS AND BURYING THEM WITH GREAT CEREMONY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0021.flac AS FOR THE KARAMAZOVS THEMSELVES HE PORTRAYS THE OLD FATHER AND THE ELDEST OF HIS SONS HATING EACH OTHER AND FIGHTING LIKE BRUTAL MANIACS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0022.flac SERVE HIM RIGHT SHOUTED DMITRI BREATHLESSLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0023.flac IF I HAVEN'T KILLED HIM I'LL COME AGAIN AND KILL HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0024.flac IT IS EASY TO SEE WHY DOSTOEVSKY HAS BECOME A POPULAR AUTHOR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0025.flac NO MELODRAMATIST EVER POURED OUT INCIDENT UPON THE STAGE FROM SUCH A HORN OF PLENTY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0026.flac DOSTOEVSKY IS ALWAYS READY TO SHOW THEM ALL IN AT ONCE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0027.flac ON TWO OPPOSITE PAGES OF THE IDIOT ONE FINDS THE FOLLOWING CHARACTERS BROUGHT IN BY NAME GENERAL EPANCHIN PRINCE S ADELAIDA IVANOVNA LIZAVETA PROKOFYEVNA YEVGENY PAVLOVITCH RADOMSKY PRINCESS BYELOKONSKY AGLAIA PRINCE MYSHKIN KOLYA IVOLGIN IPPOLIT VARYA FERDYSHCHENKO NASTASYA FILIPPOVNA NINA ALEXANDROVNA GANYA PTITSYN AND GENERAL IVOLGIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0028.flac BUT THE SECRET OF DOSTOEVSKY'S APPEAL IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THE MULTITUDE AND THRILL OF HIS INCIDENTS AND CHARACTERS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0029.flac MISTER MURRY BOLDLY FACES THE DIFFICULTY AND ATTEMPTS THE DEFINITION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0030.flac TO HIM DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK IS THE RECORD OF A GREAT MIND SEEKING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECORD OF STRUGGLE IT IS THE STRUGGLE ITSELF
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0031.flac AND THOSE VOICES TAKE SHAPE IN CERTAIN UNFORGETTABLE FRAGMENTS OF DIALOGUE THAT HAVE BEEN SPOKEN BY ONE SPIRIT TO ANOTHER IN SOME UGLY MEAN TAVERN SET IN SURROUNDING DARKNESS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0032.flac ULTIMATELY THEY ARE THE CREATIONS NOT OF A MAN WHO DESIRED TO BE BUT OF A SPIRIT WHICH SOUGHT TO KNOW
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0033.flac BECAUSE THEY ARE POSSESSED THEY ARE NO LONGER MEN AND WOMEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0034.flac THIS IS ALL IN A MEASURE TRUE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0035.flac TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DENY THE SPIRITUAL CONTENT OF DOSTOEVSKY'S WORK THE ANGUISH OF THE IMPRISONED SOUL AS IT BATTLES WITH DOUBT AND DENIAL AND DESPAIR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0036.flac THERE IS IN DOSTOEVSKY A SUGGESTION OF CALIBAN TRYING TO DISCOVER SOME BETTER GOD THAN SETEBOS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0037.flac THE ULTIMATE ATTITUDE OF DOSTOEVSKY IS AS CHRISTIAN AS THE APOSTLE PETER'S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UNBELIEF
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0038.flac AND BEYOND THE DARK NIGHT OF SUFFERING AND DISSIPATING THE NIGHT DOSTOEVSKY STILL SEES THE LIGHT OF CHRISTIAN COMPASSION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0039.flac OR EVEN BY THE COMPASSION OF OTHERS LIKE PRINCE MYSHKIN IN THE IDIOT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0040.flac HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEARS THE MARK OF THIS TERRIBLE CONFLICT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0041.flac THE NOVELS ARE THE PERFECT IMAGE OF THE MAN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0042.flac AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VICOMTE DE VOGUEE DESCRIBED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0043.flac WHEN HE BECAME EXCITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SWORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEATED ON A BENCH IN A POLICE COURT AWAITING TRIAL OR AMONG VAGABONDS WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEGGING BEFORE THE PRISON DOORS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0044.flac AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE MEEKNESS SEEN ON THE IMAGES OF OLD SLAVONIC SAINTS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0045.flac THAT IS THE PORTRAIT OF THE MAN ONE SEES BEHIND DOSTOEVSKY'S NOVELS A PORTRAIT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INFERRED FROM THE NOVELS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59150\6123-59150-0046.flac IT IS A FIGURE THAT AT ONCE FASCINATES AND REPELS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59186\6123-59186-0000.flac HE IS NOT BY TEMPERAMENT A SINGER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6123\59186\6123-59186-0001.flac HIS MUSIC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UNEVENLY MATCHED AGAINST HIS CONSCIOUSNESS OF MIDNIGHT AND STORM

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67803\6455-67803-0020.flac SHE WALKED VERY FAST AFTER SHE LEFT THE HOUSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67803\6455-67803-0021.flac BUT IT WAS NOT AGAINST HIM THAT LUCIA'S INDIGNATION WAS AROUSED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67803\6455-67803-0022.flac SHE WONDERED IF HE HAD HEARD HER LAST WORDS SHE FANCIED HE HAD

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0002.flac NO NEED TO DRESS YOURSELF LIKE THAT IF IT ISN'T EJACULATED MISTER BINNIE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0003.flac IF I WERE SURE THIS WAS THE SAME MAN I'D GO MYSELF
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0004.flac WHEN I FIND A FELLOW WHO'S NEITHER KNAVE NOR FOOL I STICK TO HIM BELIEVE I'LL SEND TO FIND OUT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0005.flac THE ONLY TIME HE HAD MADE ANY COMMENT UPON HER WAS THE FIRST TIME HE SAW HER IN THE DRESS SHE HAD COPIED FROM OCTAVIA'S NICE GOWN THAT HE BLURTED OUT DIDN'T GET IT HERE I'LL WAGER

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0011.flac AND TURNING ABOUT SHE WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0012.flac AND NOTHING MORE HAD BEEN SAID ON THE SUBJECT SINCE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0013.flac BEFORE BREAKFAST MISS BELINDA WAS STARTLED BY THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER TELEGRAM WHICH RAN AS FOLLOWS

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0017.flac OCTAVIA WAS A MARKED FIGURE UPON THE GROUNDS AT THAT GARDEN PARTY ANOTHER DRESS MY DEAR REMARKED MISSUS BURNHAM

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0026.flac VERY FEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND OCTAVIA SAID MISS BELINDA I'M NOT SURE THAT I FOLLOW ALL HER MOODS MYSELF
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0027.flac SHE IS NOT AS FRIVOLOUS AS SHE APPEARS TO THOSE WHO DON'T KNOW HER WELL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0028.flac BAROLD STOOD GNAWING HIS MUSTACHE AND MADE NO REPLY HE WAS NOT VERY COMFORTABLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0029.flac HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY FATE AND RATHER WISHED HE HAD RETURNED TO LONDON FROM BROADOAKS INSTEAD OF LOITERING IN SLOWBRIDGE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0030.flac HE HAD AMUSED HIMSELF AT FIRST BUT IN TIME HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED TO FIND HIS AMUSEMENT LOSE SOMETHING OF ITS ZEST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0031.flac IT'S DEUCEDLY BAD FORM ON HIS PART HE SAID MENTALLY WHAT DOES HE MEAN BY IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0032.flac OCTAVIA ON THE CONTRARY DID NOT ASK WHAT HE MEANT BY IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0033.flac WHERE HE EJACULATED I SAY WHAT A NAME

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6455\67804\6455-67804-0040.flac SHE HAD NOT BROUGHT LUCIA UP UNDER HER OWN EYE FOR NOTHING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6467\56885\6467-56885-0000.flac HIS BODY WAS LONG AND SLENDER HARD AND AGILE HIS SIGHT KEEN HIS AIM UNERRING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6467\56885\6467-56885-0001.flac IN THE MONTH OF AGRAHAYAN KANTI HAD GONE OUT SHOOTING NEAR THE SWAMP OF NYDIGHI WITH A FEW SPORTING COMPANIONS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6467\56885\6467-56885-0002.flac ONE MORNING AS KANTI WAS SEATED IN HIS BOAT CLEANING A FAVOURITE GUN HE SUDDENLY STARTED AT WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS THE CRY OF WILD DUCK LOOKING UP HE SAW A VILLAGE MAIDEN COMING TO THE WATER'S EDGE WITH TWO WHITE DUCKLINGS CLASPED TO HER BREAST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\6467\56885\6467-56885-0003.flac THE GIRL PUT THE BIRDS INTO THE WATER AND WATCHED THEM ANXIOUSLY

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0010.flac WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHTIEST OF THE HEROES OF GREECE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0011.flac ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BITTER FOES THE SAUROMATAE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0012.flac HE WITH HIS COMRADES WOULD SUBDUE THEM FOR YOU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0013.flac A EETES'S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WRATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHONE AS A LEOPARD'S EYES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0014.flac AND THEN SPEAKING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE JASON SAID
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0015.flac HIS HEART WAS DIVIDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUMMON HIS ARMED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLAIN UPON THE SPOT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRIAL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0016.flac IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TRULY OF THE SEED OF THE IMMORTALS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0017.flac AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRIAL OF YOU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0018.flac SHE ENTERED SOFTLY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAKING WITH HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0019.flac SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROWN OF GOLDEN HAIR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0020.flac KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ARES YONDER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATHING BULLS WITH FEET OF BRASS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0021.flac THEN I SOWED THE FURROWS NOT WITH THE SEED THAT DEMETER GIVES BUT WITH TEETH OF A DRAGON
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0022.flac IF YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS THAT I ACCOMPLISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUBMIT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLDEN FLEECE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0023.flac BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOMPLISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOMPLISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EMPTY HANDED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRAVE MAN SHOULD YIELD AUGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRAVE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0024.flac THEN JASON UTTERLY CONFOUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0025.flac I WILL DARE THIS CONTEST MONSTROUS AS IT IS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0026.flac AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MEDEA GROW WIDE AS WITH FEAR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96670\7641-96670-0027.flac PHRONTIS AND MELAS WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0000.flac AND AS A MORTAL APOLLO SOUGHT TO EARN HIS BREAD AMONGST MEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0001.flac AFTERWARD PEOPLE WONDERED AT ADMETUS'S EVER SMILING FACE AND EVER RADIANT BEING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0002.flac THAT WAS BEFORE ADMETUS SAILED ON THE ARGO WITH JASON AND THE COMPANIONS OF THE QUEST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0003.flac THEREAFTER ADMETUS HAVING THE LOVE OF ALCESTIS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0004.flac A RADIANT FIGURE IT WAS AND ADMETUS KNEW THAT THIS WAS APOLLO COME TO HIM AGAIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0005.flac BUT APOLLO TURNED TO ADMETUS A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0006.flac WHAT YEARS OF HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN MINE O APOLLO THROUGH YOUR FRIENDSHIP FOR ME SAID ADMETUS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0007.flac BUT STILL APOLLO STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0008.flac HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VIBRANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAKING TO ADMETUS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0009.flac ADMETUS ADMETUS HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SKY NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0010.flac IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADMETUS ADMETUS KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD IS SENDING DEATH FOR YOU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0011.flac IF ONE WILL GO WILLINGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CANST STILL LIVE ON GO ADMETUS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0012.flac AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN ANCIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONES IN THE COURTYARD GRINDING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0013.flac THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BLEARED AND HER KNEES SHAKING AND WITH THE DUST OF THE COURTYARD AND THE HUSKS OF THE CORN IN HER MATTED HAIR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0014.flac HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0015.flac BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HORROR CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE ANCIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0016.flac ADMETUS TOOK THE MAN'S SHRIVELED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING'S PLACE AND GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0017.flac THEN ADMETUS WENT INTO THE PALACE AND INTO THE CHAMBER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LAMENTED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD AND HE LAMENTED THAT NONE OF THE WRETCHED ONES AROUND THE PALACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0018.flac ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KING AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFFAIRS TO ATTEND TO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0019.flac NOW THE FOOTSTEPS SEEMED TO STOP
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0020.flac IT WAS NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0021.flac AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSENT TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0022.flac DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0023.flac NO NOT HERE FOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PALACE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0024.flac HE LIFTED ALCESTIS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PALACE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0025.flac NO MORE SPEECH CAME FROM HER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0026.flac AND AS FOR ADMETUS HE WENT WITHIN THE CHAMBER AND KNELT BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH ALCESTIS HAD LAIN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRIBLE LOSS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0027.flac TO WHAT GOD IS THAT SACRIFICE DUE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0028.flac AND THEN HERACLES FELT THAT ANOTHER LABOR WAS BEFORE HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0029.flac I HAVE DRAGGED UP FROM THE UNDERWORLD HE THOUGHT THE HOUND THAT GUARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRINGS DOWN INTO THE REALM OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0030.flac WHY SHOULD I NOT STRIVE WITH DEATH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0031.flac AND WHAT A NOBLE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITHFUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0032.flac HE LEFT THE PALACE OF ADMETUS AND HE WENT TO THE TEMPLE OF THE GODS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0033.flac YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UNLESS YOU PROMISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH YOU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0034.flac AND DEATH KNOWING THAT HERACLES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDERWORLD WOULD BE LEFT UNDONE IF HE WERE HELD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEMPLE WITHOUT BRINGING ONE WITH HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0035.flac SHE WAS VEILED AND ADMETUS COULD NOT SEE HER FEATURES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0036.flac HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRINGING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEMY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0037.flac THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADMETUS I HAVE HAD PANGS ENOUGH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7641\96684\7641-96684-0038.flac THEN ADMETUS RAISED THE VEIL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THRESHOLD OF HIS HOUSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0000.flac HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KNOCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0001.flac CHRISTIAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0002.flac CHRISTIAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DESTRUCTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MOUNT ZION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0003.flac I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STANDS AT THE GATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0004.flac HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLEAD FOR MEN AND A CROWN OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0005.flac CHRISTIAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0006.flac THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DUST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWEPT AND INTERPRETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWEEP IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0007.flac CHRISTIAN WHAT MEANS THIS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0008.flac THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COME IN TO LAY THE DUST SO IS SIN MADE CLEAN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0009.flac JUST AS CHRISTIAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS HIS LOAD SLID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOMB WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0010.flac AS HE STOOD THUS AND WEPT LO THREE BRIGHT ONES CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY SINS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0011.flac CHRISTIAN GAVE THREE LEAPS FOR JOY AND SANG AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BLEST CROSS BLEST TOMB
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0012.flac HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VALE WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CHAINS ON THEIR FEET
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0013.flac CHRISTIAN SIRS WHENCE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0014.flac FORMALIST AND HYPOCRISY WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF VAIN GLORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MOUNT ZION FOR PRAISE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0015.flac KNOW YOU NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CLIMBS UP TO GET IN THE SAME IS A THIEF
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0016.flac THEY TOLD CHRISTIAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SCORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROVE THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0017.flac YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0018.flac AND IF WE GET IN THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE ODDS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0019.flac IS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOURS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0020.flac I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFICULTY WHERE THERE WAS A SPRING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0021.flac NOW WHEN CHRISTIAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPRING OF LIFE HE DRANK OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0022.flac NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CAVE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0023.flac TIMOROUS SAID THAT ZION WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CLIMB BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE RISK SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0024.flac YES SAID MISTRUST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BEASTS OF PREY IN OUR PATH WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLEPT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIMBS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0025.flac YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CLOAK FOR HIS SCROLL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0026.flac HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0027.flac SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KNEES TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS SCROLL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0028.flac OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLESH AS TO USE FOR EASE THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF THE HILL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0029.flac SUCH WAS THE LOT OF THE JEWS FOR THEIR SIN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TREAD THOSE STEPS WITH GRIEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TROD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS SLEEP
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0030.flac HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0031.flac NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VALE ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPELL HE SAT DOWN AND WEPT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GLANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BENCH HE SAW HIS SCROLL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HASTE AND PUT IN HIS CLOAK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0032.flac WORDS ARE TOO WEAK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRISTIAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SCROLL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0033.flac HE LAID IT UP IN THE BREAST OF HIS COAT AND GAVE THANKS TO GOD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0034.flac WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CLIMB THE HILL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0035.flac AH THOUGHT HE THESE BEASTS RANGE IN THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PREY AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FLY FROM THEM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0036.flac THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LODGE OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCHFUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRISTIAN MADE A HALT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0037.flac FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BEASTS FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CHAINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HAVE NONE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0038.flac KEEP IN THE MIDST OF THE PATH AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO THEE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0039.flac THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DREAD OF THE WILD BEASTS HE HEARD THEM ROAR YET THEY DID HIM NO HARM BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LODGE WHERE WATCHFUL DWELT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0040.flac CHRISTIAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0041.flac WHEN WATCHFUL TOLD HER WHY CHRISTIAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0042.flac THEN CHRISTIAN BENT DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH THEM TO THE HOUSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0043.flac PIETY COME GOOD CHRISTIAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROMPTS US TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0044.flac CHRISTIAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0045.flac PRUDENCE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MOUNT ZION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0046.flac THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL DWELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0047.flac CHARITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BABES CHRISTIAN YES I HAVE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0048.flac CHARITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0049.flac BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0050.flac THUS DID CHRISTIAN TALK WITH THESE FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLEPT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SANG A HYMN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0051.flac AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE JAW BONE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SAMSON DID SUCH GREAT FEATS AND THE SLING AND STONE WITH WHICH DAVID SLEW GOLIATH OF GATH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0052.flac WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRISTIAN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105815\7697-105815-0053.flac THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IMMANUEL'S LAND
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105817\7697-105817-0000.flac MORE THAN THIS HE HATH BEEN HEARD TO RAIL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUDGE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105817\7697-105817-0001.flac JUDGE THY JUST DOOM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SPOT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105817\7697-105817-0002.flac THEN THE JUDGE TO SUM UP THE CASE SPOKE THUS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A STIR IN OUR TOWN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105817\7697-105817-0003.flac THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TREAD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRISTIAN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105817\7697-105817-0004.flac COME GOOD HOPEFUL SAID CHRISTIAN LET US WALK ON THE GRASS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105817\7697-105817-0005.flac SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105817\7697-105817-0006.flac HOPEFUL I HAD MY FEARS FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A HINT CHRISTIAN GOOD FRIEND I GRIEVE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PATH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105817\7697-105817-0007.flac HOPEFUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105817\7697-105817-0008.flac CHRISTIAN WE MUST NOT STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105817\7697-105817-0009.flac THEN SAID GIANT DESPAIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105817\7697-105817-0010.flac THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FAULT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\105817\7697-105817-0011.flac AND BY THIS ACT WE KILL OUR SOULS AS WELL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0000.flac FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0001.flac THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO MASTERSHIP OF THE ANIMALS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0002.flac THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BEFORE MAN HAD DISOBEYED NOTHING DISOBEYED HIM THAT WAS NATURALLY SUBJECT TO HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0003.flac SECONDLY THIS IS PROVED BY THE ORDER OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE WHICH ALWAYS GOVERNS INFERIOR THINGS BY THE SUPERIOR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0004.flac THIRDLY THIS IS PROVED FROM A PROPERTY OF MAN AND OF OTHER ANIMALS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0005.flac NOW WHATEVER IS PARTICIPATED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ESSENTIAL AND UNIVERSAL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0006.flac THEREFORE THE SUBJECTION OF OTHER ANIMALS TO MAN IS PROVED TO BE NATURAL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0007.flac THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF MAN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT ARE THEY FOR THAT REASON EXCEPTED FROM THE MASTERSHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROVIDENCE HAS ORDAINED ALL THIS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0008.flac THIS IS SIGNIFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED THE ANIMALS TO MAN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAMES EXPRESSIVE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NATURES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0009.flac SO ALL ANIMALS WOULD HAVE OBEYED MAN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DOMESTIC ANIMALS OBEY HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0010.flac OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTERSHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREATURES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0011.flac MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD IT HAVE OBEYED MAN IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0012.flac THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY HIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMPETENT TO HAVE MASTERSHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN HAD NO DOMINION OVER PLANTS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0013.flac NOW IN MAN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0014.flac I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEEDS ADMIT THAT IN THE PRIMITIVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME INEQUALITY AT LEAST AS REGARDS SEX BECAUSE GENERATION DEPENDS UPON DIVERSITY OF SEX AND LIKEWISE AS REGARDS AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SEXUAL UNION HAVE BEEN STERILE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0015.flac THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BODILY DISPARITY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0016.flac INEQUALITY MIGHT ALSO ARISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITHOUT ANY DEFECT OF NATURE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0017.flac OBJECTION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0018.flac THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0019.flac IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTERSHIP IS REFERRED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFICE OF GOVERNING AND DIRECTING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245712\7697-245712-0020.flac SUCH A KIND OF MASTERSHIP WOULD HAVE EXISTED IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASONS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245715\7697-245715-0000.flac BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WEAKNESS OF OLD AGE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245715\7697-245715-0001.flac ON THE CONTRARY EVERYTHING GENERATED IS FIRST IMPERFECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEGOTTEN BY GENERATION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245715\7697-245715-0002.flac THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPERFECT IN BODILY SIZE AND POWER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\7697\245715\7697-245715-0003.flac THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INNOCENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTRARY NATURE'S PROCESS IN GENERATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HARMONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS ESTABLISHED BY GOD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0000.flac I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRANDT IS IN PRISON FOR DEBT I SAID
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0001.flac AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELPLESS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0002.flac HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARRESTED SHE REJOINED SADLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0003.flac HIS CRUEL CREDITORS ARE MORE TO BLAME THAN HE IS FOR THE POVERTY THAT HAS FALLEN ON US
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0004.flac EVEN THIS NEGATIVE DEFENSE OF VAN BRANDT STUNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKEN MORE GUARDEDLY OF HIM I SAID BITTERLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0005.flac I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORGIVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAT A MAN CAN INFLICT ON HER WHEN HE IS THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0006.flac SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0007.flac HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CRUELLY TO ME SHE ASKED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0008.flac YOU KNOW TO MY SHAME I CONFESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL YOURS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0009.flac WHAT WRONG ARE YOU TALKING OF
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0010.flac IS IT THE WRONG I SUFFERED WHEN VAN BRANDT MARRIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0011.flac DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORGET THE GREAT MISFORTUNE OF MY LIFE THE MISFORTUNE THAT HAS MADE ME UNWORTHY OF YOU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0012.flac IT IS NO FAULT OF MINE GOD KNOWS BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MARRIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DARLING WHO IS PLAYING OUT THERE WITH HER DOLL IS MY CHILD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0013.flac AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOWING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPTS ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0014.flac IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPPIER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PRIDE AS THE CHILD PRIDE SHE REPEATED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0015.flac IN SUCH A POSITION AS MINE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0016.flac A HELPLESS WOMAN WITH A MOCK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DEBT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0017.flac AM I TO MARRY YOU FOR MY FOOD AND SHELTER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0018.flac AM I TO MARRY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAWFUL TIE THAT BINDS ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0019.flac BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FORSAKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCED AWAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0020.flac MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UNGRATEFUL ENOUGH TO CONSENT TO BE YOUR WIFE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0021.flac THE WOMAN IN MY SITUATION MUST BE HEARTLESS INDEED WHO COULD DESTROY YOUR PLACE IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0022.flac THE WRETCHEDEST CREATURE THAT WALKS THE STREETS WOULD SHRINK FROM TREATING YOU IN THAT WAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0023.flac OH WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/dev-other\8173\294714\8173-294714-0041.flac YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OBTAINED AN EXCELLENT OFFER OF EMPLOYMENT ABROAD FROM A RICH RELATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO ACCEPT IT
