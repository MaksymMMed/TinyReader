c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0001.flac THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0002.flac FRUIT GATHERED IN WET OR FOGGY WEATHER WILL SOON BE MILDEWED AND BE OF NO SERVICE FOR PRESERVES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0003.flac BUT TO DISTINGUISH THESE PROPERLY REQUIRES VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0004.flac IF YOU DIP THE FINGER INTO THE SYRUP AND APPLY IT TO THE THUMB THE TENACITY OF THE SYRUP WILL ON SEPARATING THE FINGER AND THUMB AFFORD A THREAD WHICH SHORTLY BREAKS THIS IS THE LITTLE THREAD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0005.flac LET IT BOIL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REMOVE CAREFULLY THE SCUM THAT HAS RISEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0006.flac IT IS CONSIDERED TO BE SUFFICIENTLY BOILED WHEN SOME TAKEN UP IN A SPOON POURS OUT LIKE OIL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0007.flac BEFORE SUGAR WAS IN USE HONEY WAS EMPLOYED TO PRESERVE MANY VEGETABLE PRODUCTIONS THOUGH THIS SUBSTANCE HAS NOW GIVEN WAY TO THE JUICE OF THE SUGAR CANE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0008.flac FOURTEEN NINETY NINE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0009.flac BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0010.flac THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0011.flac FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WILL BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0012.flac THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0013.flac IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0014.flac MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTES ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0015.flac MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRESERVES OF A HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0016.flac THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0017.flac IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0018.flac CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0019.flac IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICERE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CUISINE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0020.flac THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0021.flac HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGNS OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0022.flac THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0024.flac AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\142836\3538-142836-0026.flac THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163619\3538-163619-0000.flac THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A WIDOWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163619\3538-163619-0001.flac FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN'S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORNER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EARN HIS OWN BREAD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163619\3538-163619-0002.flac BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FARED WORSE AND WORSE

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163619\3538-163619-0008.flac WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163619\3538-163619-0009.flac ON THE FIRST THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN CAME INTO THE KITCHEN OF THE PALACE AND BEGGED THE KITCHEN MAID WHO SLEPT THERE TO LEND HER A BRUSH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163619\3538-163619-0010.flac SHE BEGGED VERY PRETTILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BRUSHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DROPPED FROM IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163619\3538-163619-0011.flac OUT ON THEE UGLY BUSHY BRIDE SLEEPING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING'S SIDE ON SAND AND STONES MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEPS WITH THE COLD SNAKE UNPITIED AND UNWEPT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163619\3538-163619-0012.flac I SHALL COME TWICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163619\3538-163619-0013.flac THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BORROWED A BRUSH AND BRUSHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DROPPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DAWNED SHE DEPARTED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163619\3538-163619-0014.flac NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHTED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT HIDEOUS BUSHY BRIDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0000.flac WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS ASKED THE KING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0001.flac THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WATCH THE FOALS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0002.flac HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0003.flac YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0004.flac HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0005.flac THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0006.flac WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0007.flac COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0008.flac THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0009.flac SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0010.flac ON THE THIRD DAY CINDERLAD WANTED TO SET OUT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0011.flac THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDERLAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0017.flac IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0018.flac CINDERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0019.flac FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0020.flac WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0022.flac NOW THEN SAID THE FOAL DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0023.flac THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163622\3538-163622-0024.flac I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED CINDERLAD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163624\3538-163624-0000.flac ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WARS BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163624\3538-163624-0001.flac THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FOUGHT BRAVELY BUT AT LAST HIS SWORD BROKE AND HE WAS WOUNDED AND HIS MEN FLED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\3538\163624\3538-163624-0002.flac BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BATTLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEARCHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLAIN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEALED

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4294\9934\4294-9934-0024.flac THE LANDLORD PRESENTED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PAID ON THE SPOT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4294\9934\4294-9934-0025.flac I HAVE TEN FRANCS LEFT SAID MARIUS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4294\9934\4294-9934-0026.flac THAT WILL BE SWALLOWING A TONGUE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOUS VERY SLOWLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4294\9934\4294-9934-0027.flac ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MARIUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIXTY PISTOLES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FRANCS IN GOLD IN A SEALED BOX
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4294\9934\4294-9934-0028.flac MARIUS SENT BACK THE THIRTY LOUIS TO HIS AUNT WITH A RESPECTFUL LETTER IN WHICH HE STATED THAT HE HAD SUFFICIENT MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE AND THAT HE SHOULD BE ABLE THENCEFORTH TO SUPPLY ALL HIS NEEDS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4294\9934\4294-9934-0029.flac AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FRANCS LEFT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0000.flac HE PERCEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALKING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCIPAL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0001.flac BEFORE HER HE DECIDED TO SCATTER HIS PEARLS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0002.flac THE PRINCESS WAS DISTRACTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD SINNED AGAINST KITTY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0003.flac WELL DOCTOR DECIDE OUR FATE SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0004.flac IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QUIVERED AND SHE COULD NOT UTTER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0005.flac AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A SIGH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0006.flac THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECTFULLY CEASED IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS OBSERVATIONS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0007.flac AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS MALNUTRITION NERVOUS EXCITABILITY AND SO ON
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0008.flac THE QUESTION STANDS THUS IN PRESENCE OF INDICATIONS OF TUBERCULOUS PROCESS WHAT IS TO BE DONE TO MAINTAIN NUTRITION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0009.flac YES THAT'S AN UNDERSTOOD THING RESPONDED THE CELEBRATED PHYSICIAN AGAIN GLANCING AT HIS WATCH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0010.flac BEG PARDON IS THE YAUSKY BRIDGE DONE YET OR SHALL I HAVE TO DRIVE AROUND
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0011.flac HE ASKED AH IT IS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0012.flac OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0013.flac AND HOW ABOUT A TOUR ABROAD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0014.flac WHAT IS WANTED IS MEANS OF IMPROVING NUTRITION AND NOT FOR LOWERING IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0015.flac THE FAMILY DOCTOR LISTENED ATTENTIVELY AND RESPECTFULLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0016.flac BUT IN FAVOR OF FOREIGN TRAVEL I WOULD URGE THE CHANGE OF HABITS THE REMOVAL FROM CONDITIONS CALLING UP REMINISCENCES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0017.flac AND THEN THE MOTHER WISHES IT HE ADDED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0018.flac AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GERMAN QUACKS ARE MISCHIEVOUS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0019.flac OH TIME'S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0020.flac THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR ANNOUNCED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DUE FROM HIM DICTATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PATIENT ONCE MORE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0021.flac OH NO ONLY A FEW DETAILS PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0022.flac AND THE MOTHER ACCOMPANIED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAWING ROOM TO KITTY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0023.flac WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FLUSHED CRIMSON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0024.flac SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FURIOUS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0025.flac EXCUSE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0026.flac THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU'VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0027.flac THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFFENSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0028.flac NERVOUS IRRITABILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN KITTY HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FINISHED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0029.flac AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SCIENTIFICALLY EXPLAINING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPTIONALLY INTELLIGENT WOMAN THE CONDITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CONCLUDED BY INSISTING ON THE DRINKING OF THE WATERS WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HARMLESS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0030.flac AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO ABROAD THE DOCTOR PLUNGED INTO DEEP MEDITATION AS THOUGH RESOLVING A WEIGHTY PROBLEM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0031.flac FINALLY HIS DECISION WAS PRONOUNCED THEY WERE TO GO ABROAD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FOREIGN QUACKS AND TO APPLY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0032.flac IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIECE OF GOOD FORTUNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\10919\4350-10919-0033.flac THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHEERFUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND KITTY PRETENDED TO BE MORE CHEERFUL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0000.flac EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0001.flac THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0002.flac IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0003.flac THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0004.flac THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0005.flac THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0006.flac THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0007.flac THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0008.flac THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0009.flac POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0010.flac INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0011.flac ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0012.flac BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0013.flac EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARD OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0014.flac BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0015.flac IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0016.flac AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0017.flac BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0018.flac INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0019.flac GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0020.flac AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0021.flac THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0022.flac SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0023.flac FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0024.flac THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0025.flac THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0026.flac THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0027.flac AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0028.flac BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0029.flac AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0030.flac THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0031.flac EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0032.flac THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0033.flac THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0034.flac AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0035.flac THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0036.flac IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0037.flac BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0038.flac BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0039.flac THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0040.flac THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0041.flac BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0042.flac GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0043.flac THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0044.flac AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0045.flac I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0046.flac EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0047.flac WE KNOW NOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0048.flac SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0049.flac EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0050.flac WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0051.flac THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0052.flac THE GREAT EXTENSION OF MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS HAS MADE MEN COMPLETELY ABLE TO DISPENSE WITH STATE AID IN FORMING SOCIETIES ASSOCIATIONS CORPORATIONS AND CONGRESSES FOR SCIENTIFIC ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL OBJECTS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0053.flac WITHOUT GOVERNMENTS NATIONS WOULD BE ENSLAVED BY THEIR NEIGHBORS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0054.flac THE GOVERNMENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARMY IS NECESSARY TO DEFEND US FROM NEIGHBORING STATES WHO MIGHT ENSLAVE US
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0055.flac AND IF DEFENSE AGAINST BARBAROUS NATIONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSANDTH PART OF THE TROOPS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AMPLY SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0056.flac THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SECURITY AGAINST THE ATTACKS OF OUR NEIGHBORS EXPOSES US ON THE CONTRARY TO MUCH GREATER DANGER OF SUCH ATTACKS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0057.flac EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACTICALLY WEIGHING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BURDENS LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FAIL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSONALLY TO COMPLY WITH STATE DEMANDS AND SERVE IN THE ARMY WOULD IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES BE MORE DISADVANTAGEOUS THAN TO REFUSE TO DO SO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0058.flac TO RESIST WOULD NEED INDEPENDENT THOUGHT AND EFFORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAPABLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0059.flac SO MUCH FOR THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF BOTH LINES OF CONDUCT FOR A MAN OF THE WEALTHY CLASSES AN OPPRESSOR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4350\9170\4350-9170-0060.flac FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORKING CLASS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INCREASE OF DISADVANTAGES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0000.flac SAY YOU KNOW SUMTHIN

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0005.flac MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT INTO M STREET

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0007.flac CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0008.flac THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0009.flac HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKEY WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGING INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0010.flac MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTLY ENCOURAGED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0011.flac BETCHA AREN'T GOIN AFTER ALL CHRIS TURNED ON HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0012.flac MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE CORNER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0013.flac AW SHUCKS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0014.flac CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0015.flac AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0016.flac THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK HAD A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ONTO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUBS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0017.flac A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0018.flac THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH HIS JOB
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0019.flac ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0020.flac AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0021.flac THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0022.flac ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0023.flac BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0024.flac HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0025.flac HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28311\4852-28311-0026.flac A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0000.flac OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAMINED MISTER WICKER'S WINDOW AND PORED OVER THE ROPE THE SHIP AND THE NUBIAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0001.flac SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOMEONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED EAGERLY IF UNEASILY AROUND HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0002.flac WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0003.flac HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0004.flac MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0005.flac THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEKBONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0006.flac LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0007.flac CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0008.flac CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0009.flac YES SIR HE SAID
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0010.flac I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0011.flac HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0012.flac JAKEY HARRIS HIS NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0013.flac I I JUST WONDERED IF THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0014.flac WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0015.flac HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0016.flac WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKEY'S GETTING THE JOB SIR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0017.flac BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WATER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0018.flac THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY STILL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0019.flac THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0020.flac THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0021.flac ACROSS THE WATER WHERE WAS THE FREEWAY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0022.flac IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0023.flac THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0024.flac FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0025.flac NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLIT STREETS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0026.flac WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUGSTORE HAD STOOD BUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0027.flac A COURTYARD WAS SPARSELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0028.flac THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0029.flac A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAGGED COURTYARD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0030.flac THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28312\4852-28312-0031.flac MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0000.flac THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0001.flac HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0002.flac CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0003.flac ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0004.flac WHAT SHALL I DO FIRST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0005.flac HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0006.flac SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0007.flac MISTER WICKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0008.flac THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WICKER SAID START AT ONCE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0009.flac THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0010.flac HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0011.flac HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED CLOSE BY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0012.flac SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ONE THE RETURN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0013.flac THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE HAD CURVED UP POINTING TOES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0014.flac THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0015.flac IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0016.flac HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINING THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0017.flac BUT HOW DID ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0018.flac CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0019.flac HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY CHRIS RESUMED HIS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0020.flac THE AFTERNOON RAINY BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0021.flac DUSK CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLED IN THE SKY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0022.flac CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0023.flac MISTER WICKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOORBOARDS CREAKED AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE POTION FUMED AND GLOWED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0024.flac WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0025.flac IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0026.flac UNDER HIS EYES THE WOODEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28319\4852-28319-0027.flac THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET THE BOUQUET FALL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0000.flac THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0001.flac GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0002.flac NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ELBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0003.flac IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0004.flac THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHITI
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0005.flac WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON THERE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0006.flac CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0007.flac CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0008.flac MISTER FINNEY WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0009.flac HIS FACE FROZE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0010.flac THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0011.flac THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0012.flac THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0013.flac HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0014.flac WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0015.flac THIS SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0016.flac YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SIR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0017.flac CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN HIS WINNING SMILE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0018.flac HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0019.flac CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANYONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTOOD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0020.flac WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS THOUGHT TO ASK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0021.flac I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0022.flac I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0023.flac NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WICKER HAD CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0024.flac HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\4852\28330\4852-28330-0025.flac THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0000.flac WHEN CHURCHYARDS YAWN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0001.flac I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSANDS OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LOCKED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0002.flac I AM SURE I KISSED LIDDY AND I HAVE HAD TERRIBLE MOMENTS SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER KISSING MISTER JAMIESON TOO IN THE EXCITEMENT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0003.flac FORTUNATELY WARNER AND THE DETECTIVES WERE KEEPING BACHELOR HALL IN THE LODGE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0004.flac OUT OF DEFERENCE TO LIDDY THEY WASHED THEIR DISHES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CONCOCTED QUEER MESSES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEVERAL ABILITIES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0005.flac MISS INNES HE SAID STOPPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP STAIRS HOW ARE YOUR NERVES TONIGHT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0006.flac I HAVE NONE I SAID HAPPILY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0007.flac I MEAN HE PERSISTED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UNUSUAL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0008.flac THE MOST UNUSUAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACEFUL NIGHT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0009.flac SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCCUR HE SAID
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0010.flac PUT ON HEAVY SHOES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTHES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPRISED AT ANYTHING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0011.flac LIDDY WAS SLEEPING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP STAIRS AND I HUNTED OUT MY THINGS CAUTIOUSLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\533\1066\533-1066-0012.flac THEY WERE TALKING CONFIDENTIALLY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CEASED

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0010.flac BUT LEVIN FORGOT ALL THAT AND IT WAS PAINFUL TO HIM TO SEE ALL THESE EXCELLENT PERSONS FOR WHOM HE HAD A RESPECT IN SUCH AN UNPLEASANT AND VICIOUS STATE OF EXCITEMENT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0011.flac TO ESCAPE FROM THIS PAINFUL FEELING HE WENT AWAY INTO THE OTHER ROOM WHERE THERE WAS NOBODY EXCEPT THE WAITERS AT THE REFRESHMENT BAR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0012.flac HE PARTICULARLY LIKED THE WAY ONE GRAY WHISKERED WAITER WHO SHOWED HIS SCORN FOR THE OTHER YOUNGER ONES AND WAS JEERED AT BY THEM WAS TEACHING THEM HOW TO FOLD UP NAPKINS PROPERLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0013.flac LEVIN ADVANCED BUT UTTERLY FORGETTING WHAT HE WAS TO DO AND MUCH EMBARRASSED HE TURNED TO SERGEY IVANOVITCH WITH THE QUESTION WHERE AM I TO PUT IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0014.flac SERGEY IVANOVITCH FROWNED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0015.flac THAT IS A MATTER FOR EACH MAN'S OWN DECISION HE SAID SEVERELY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0016.flac HAVING PUT IT IN HE RECOLLECTED THAT HE OUGHT TO HAVE THRUST HIS LEFT HAND TOO AND SO HE THRUST IT IN THOUGH TOO LATE AND STILL MORE OVERCOME WITH CONFUSION HE BEAT A HASTY RETREAT INTO THE BACKGROUND
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0017.flac A HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX FOR ADMISSION NINETY EIGHT AGAINST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0018.flac SANG OUT THE VOICE OF THE SECRETARY WHO COULD NOT PRONOUNCE THE LETTER R
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0019.flac THEN THERE WAS A LAUGH A BUTTON AND TWO NUTS WERE FOUND IN THE BOX
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0020.flac BUT THE OLD PARTY DID NOT CONSIDER THEMSELVES CONQUERED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0021.flac IN REPLY SNETKOV SPOKE OF THE TRUST THE NOBLEMEN OF THE PROVINCE HAD PLACED IN HIM THE AFFECTION THEY HAD SHOWN HIM WHICH HE DID NOT DESERVE AS HIS ONLY MERIT HAD BEEN HIS ATTACHMENT TO THE NOBILITY TO WHOM HE HAD DEVOTED TWELVE YEARS OF SERVICE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0022.flac THIS EXPRESSION IN THE MARSHAL'S FACE WAS PARTICULARLY TOUCHING TO LEVIN BECAUSE ONLY THE DAY BEFORE HE HAD BEEN AT HIS HOUSE ABOUT HIS TRUSTEE BUSINESS AND HAD SEEN HIM IN ALL HIS GRANDEUR A KIND HEARTED FATHERLY MAN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0023.flac IF THERE ARE MEN YOUNGER AND MORE DESERVING THAN I LET THEM SERVE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0024.flac AND THE MARSHAL DISAPPEARED THROUGH A SIDE DOOR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0025.flac THEY WERE TO PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO THE ELECTION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0026.flac TWO NOBLE GENTLEMEN WHO HAD A WEAKNESS FOR STRONG DRINK HAD BEEN MADE DRUNK BY THE PARTISANS OF SNETKOV AND A THIRD HAD BEEN ROBBED OF HIS UNIFORM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41168\5442-41168-0027.flac ON LEARNING THIS THE NEW PARTY HAD MADE HASTE DURING THE DISPUTE ABOUT FLEROV TO SEND SOME OF THEIR MEN IN A SLEDGE TO CLOTHE THE STRIPPED GENTLEMAN AND TO BRING ALONG ONE OF THE INTOXICATED TO THE MEETING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0000.flac LEVIN DID NOT CARE TO EAT AND HE WAS NOT SMOKING HE DID NOT WANT TO JOIN HIS OWN FRIENDS THAT IS SERGEY IVANOVITCH STEPAN ARKADYEVITCH SVIAZHSKY AND THE REST BECAUSE VRONSKY IN HIS EQUERRY'S UNIFORM WAS STANDING WITH THEM IN EAGER CONVERSATION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0001.flac HE WENT TO THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN SCANNING THE GROUPS AND LISTENING TO WHAT WAS BEING SAID AROUND HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0002.flac HE'S SUCH A BLACKGUARD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0003.flac I HAVE TOLD HIM SO BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE ONLY THINK OF IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0004.flac THESE PERSONS WERE UNMISTAKABLY SEEKING A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD TALK WITHOUT BEING OVERHEARD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0005.flac SHALL WE GO ON YOUR EXCELLENCY FINE CHAMPAGNE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0006.flac LAST YEAR AT OUR DISTRICT MARSHAL NIKOLAY IVANOVITCH'S
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0007.flac OH STILL JUST THE SAME ALWAYS AT A LOSS THE LANDOWNER ANSWERED WITH A RESIGNED SMILE BUT WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SERENITY AND CONVICTION THAT SO IT MUST BE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0008.flac WHY WHAT IS THERE TO UNDERSTAND
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0009.flac THERE'S NO MEANING IN IT AT ALL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0010.flac THEN TOO ONE MUST KEEP UP CONNECTIONS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0011.flac IT'S A MORAL OBLIGATION OF A SORT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0012.flac AND THEN TO TELL THE TRUTH THERE'S ONE'S OWN INTERESTS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0013.flac THEY'RE PROPRIETORS OF A SORT BUT WE'RE THE LANDOWNERS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0014.flac THAT IT MAY BE BUT STILL IT OUGHT TO BE TREATED A LITTLE MORE RESPECTFULLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0015.flac IF WE'RE LAYING OUT A GARDEN PLANNING ONE BEFORE THE HOUSE YOU KNOW AND THERE YOU'VE A TREE THAT'S STOOD FOR CENTURIES IN THE VERY SPOT OLD AND GNARLED IT MAY BE AND YET YOU DON'T CUT DOWN THE OLD FELLOW TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE FLOWERBEDS BUT LAY OUT YOUR BEDS SO AS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TREE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0016.flac WELL AND HOW IS YOUR LAND DOING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0017.flac BUT ONE'S WORK IS THROWN IN FOR NOTHING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0018.flac OH WELL ONE DOES IT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0019.flac AND WHAT'S MORE THE LANDOWNER WENT ON LEANING HIS ELBOWS ON THE WINDOW AND CHATTING ON MY SON I MUST TELL YOU HAS NO TASTE FOR IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0020.flac SO THERE'LL BE NO ONE TO KEEP IT UP AND YET ONE DOES IT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0021.flac WE WALKED ABOUT THE FIELDS AND THE GARDEN NO SAID HE STEPAN VASSILIEVITCH EVERYTHING'S WELL LOOKED AFTER BUT YOUR GARDEN'S NEGLECTED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0022.flac TO MY THINKING I'D CUT DOWN THAT LIME TREE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0023.flac HERE YOU'VE THOUSANDS OF LIMES AND EACH WOULD MAKE TWO GOOD BUNDLES OF BARK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0024.flac YOU'RE MARRIED I'VE HEARD SAID THE LANDOWNER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0025.flac YES IT'S RATHER STRANGE HE WENT ON
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0026.flac THE LANDOWNER CHUCKLED UNDER HIS WHITE MUSTACHES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0027.flac WHY DON'T WE CUT DOWN OUR PARKS FOR TIMBER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0028.flac SAID LEVIN RETURNING TO A THOUGHT THAT HAD STRUCK HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0029.flac THERE'S A CLASS INSTINCT TOO OF WHAT ONE OUGHT AND OUGHTN'T TO DO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0030.flac THERE'S THE PEASANTS TOO I WONDER AT THEM SOMETIMES ANY GOOD PEASANT TRIES TO TAKE ALL THE LAND HE CAN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5442\41169\5442-41169-0031.flac WITHOUT A RETURN TOO AT A SIMPLE LOSS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0000.flac WHEN HE CAME FROM THE BATH PROCLUS VISITED HIM AGAIN
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0001.flac BUT HERMON WAS NOT IN THE MOOD TO SHARE A JOYOUS REVEL AND HE FRANKLY SAID SO ALTHOUGH IMMEDIATELY AFTER HIS RETURN HE HAD ACCEPTED THE INVITATION TO THE FESTIVAL WHICH THE WHOLE FELLOWSHIP OF ARTISTS WOULD GIVE THE FOLLOWING DAY IN HONOUR OF THE SEVENTIETH BIRTHDAY OF THE OLD SCULPTOR EUPHRANOR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0002.flac SHE WOULD APPEAR HERSELF AT DESSERT AND THE BANQUET MUST THEREFORE BEGIN AT AN UNUSUALLY EARLY HOUR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0003.flac SO THE ARTIST FOUND HIMSELF OBLIGED TO RELINQUISH HIS OPPOSITION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0004.flac THE BANQUET WAS TO BEGIN IN A FEW HOURS YET HE COULD NOT LET THE DAY PASS WITHOUT SEEING DAPHNE AND TELLING HER THE WORDS OF THE ORACLE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0005.flac HE LONGED WITH ARDENT YEARNING FOR THE SOUND OF HER VOICE AND STILL MORE TO UNBURDEN HIS SORELY TROUBLED SOUL TO HER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0006.flac SINCE HIS RETURN FROM THE ORACLE THE FEAR THAT THE RESCUED DEMETER MIGHT YET BE THE WORK OF MYRTILUS HAD AGAIN MASTERED HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0007.flac THE APPROVAL AS WELL AS THE DOUBTS WHICH IT AROUSED IN OTHERS STRENGTHENED HIS OPINION ALTHOUGH EVEN NOW HE COULD NOT SUCCEED IN BRINGING IT INTO HARMONY WITH THE FACTS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0008.flac THEN HE WENT DIRECTLY TO THE NEIGHBOURING PALACE THE QUEEN MIGHT HAVE APPEARED ALREADY AND IT WOULD NOT DO TO KEEP HER WAITING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0009.flac HITHERTO THE MERCHANT HAD BEEN INDUCED IT IS TRUE TO ADVANCE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY TO THE QUEEN BUT THE LOYAL DEVOTION WHICH HE SHOWED TO HER ROYAL HUSBAND HAD RENDERED IT IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE HIM EVEN A HINT OF THE CONSPIRACY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0010.flac WHEN HERMON ENTERED THE RESIDENCE OF THE GRAMMATEUS IN THE PALACE THE GUESTS HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0011.flac THE PLACE BY HERMON'S SIDE WHICH ALTHEA HAD CHOSEN FOR HERSELF WOULD THEN BE GIVEN UP TO ARSINOE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0012.flac TRUE AN INTERESTING CONVERSATION STILL HAD POWER TO CHARM HIM BUT OFTEN DURING ITS CONTINUANCE THE FULL CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS MISFORTUNE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS MIND FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SUBJECTS DISCUSSED BY THE ARTISTS CAME TO THEM THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF SIGHT AND REFERRED TO NEW CREATIONS OF ARCHITECTURE SCULPTURE AND PAINTING FROM WHOSE ENJOYMENT HIS BLINDNESS DEBARRED HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0013.flac A STRANGER OUT OF HIS OWN SPHERE HE FELT CHILLED AMONG THESE CLOSELY UNITED MEN AND WOMEN TO WHOM NO TIE BOUND HIM SAVE THE PRESENCE OF THE SAME HOST
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0014.flac CRATES HAD REALLY BEEN INVITED IN ORDER TO WIN HIM OVER TO THE QUEEN'S CAUSE BUT CHARMING FAIR HAIRED NICO HAD BEEN COMMISSIONED BY THE CONSPIRATORS TO PERSUADE HIM TO SING ARSINOE'S PRAISES AMONG HIS PROFESSIONAL ASSOCIATES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0015.flac HIS SON HAD BEEN THIS ROYAL DAME'S FIRST HUSBAND AND SHE HAD DESERTED HIM TO MARRY LYSIMACHUS THE AGED KING OF THRACE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0016.flac THE KING'S SISTER THE OBJECT OF HIS LOVE CRIED HERMON INCREDULOUSLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0017.flac WE WOMEN ARE ONLY AS OLD AS WE LOOK AND THE LEECHES AND TIRING WOMEN OF THIS BEAUTY OF FORTY PRACTISE ARTS WHICH GIVE HER THE APPEARANCE OF TWENTY FIVE YET PERHAPS THE KING VALUES HER INTELLECT MORE THAN HER PERSON AND THE WISDOM OF A HUNDRED SERPENTS IS CERTAINLY UNITED IN THIS WOMAN'S HEAD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0018.flac THE THREE MOST TRUSTWORTHY ONES ARE HERE AMYNTAS THE LEECH CHRYSIPPUS AND THE ADMIRABLE PROCLUS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0019.flac LET US HOPE THAT YOU WILL MAKE THIS THREE LEAVED CLOVER THE LUCK PROMISING FOUR LEAVED ONE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0020.flac YOUR UNCLE TOO HAS OFTEN WITH PRAISEWORTHY GENEROSITY HELPED ARSINOE IN MANY AN EMBARRASSMENT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0021.flac HOW LONG HE KEPT YOU WAITING FOR THE FIRST WORD CONCERNING A WORK WHICH JUSTLY TRANSPORTED THE WHOLE CITY WITH DELIGHT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0022.flac WHEN HE DID FINALLY SUMMON YOU HE SAID THINGS WHICH MUST HAVE WOUNDED YOU
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0023.flac THAT IS GOING TOO FAR REPLIED HERMON
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0024.flac HE WINKED AT HER AND MADE A SIGNIFICANT GESTURE AS HE SPOKE AND THEN INFORMED THE BLIND ARTIST HOW GRACIOUSLY ARSINOE HAD REMEMBERED HIM WHEN SHE HEARD OF THE REMEDY BY WHOSE AID MANY A WONDERFUL CURE OF BLIND EYES HAD BEEN MADE IN RHODES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0025.flac THE ROYAL LADY HAD INQUIRED ABOUT HIM AND HIS SUFFERINGS WITH ALMOST SISTERLY INTEREST AND ALTHEA EAGERLY CONFIRMED THE STATEMENT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0026.flac HERMON LISTENED TO THE PAIR IN SILENCE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0027.flac THE RHODIAN WAS JUST BEGINNING TO PRAISE ARSINOE ALSO AS A SPECIAL FRIEND AND CONNOISSEUR OF THE SCULPTOR'S ART WHEN CRATES HERMON'S FELLOW STUDENT ASKED THE BLIND ARTIST IN BEHALF OF HIS BEAUTIFUL COMPANION WHY HIS DEMETER WAS PLACED UPON A PEDESTAL WHICH TO OTHERS AS WELL AS HIMSELF SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE SIZE OF THE STATUE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0028.flac YET WHAT MATTERED IT EVEN IF THESE MISERABLE PEOPLE CONSIDERED THEMSELVES DECEIVED AND POINTED THE FINGER OF SCORN AT HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0029.flac A WOMAN WHO YEARNS FOR THE REGARD OF ALL MEN AND MAKES LOVE A TOY EASILY LESSENS THE DEMANDS SHE IMPOSES UPON INDIVIDUALS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0030.flac ONLY EVEN THOUGH LOVE HAS WHOLLY DISAPPEARED SHE STILL CLAIMS CONSIDERATION AND ALTHEA DID NOT WISH TO LOSE HERMON'S REGARD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0031.flac HOW INDIFFERENT YOU LOOK BUT I TELL YOU HER DEEP BLUE EYES FLASHED AS SHE SPOKE THAT SO LONG AS YOU WERE STILL A GENUINE CREATING ARTIST THE CASE WAS DIFFERENT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0032.flac THOUGH SO LOUD A DENIAL IS WRITTEN ON YOUR FACE I PERSIST IN MY CONVICTION AND THAT NO IDLE DELUSION ENSNARES ME I CAN PROVE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24317\5484-24317-0033.flac IT WAS NAY IT COULD HAVE BEEN NOTHING ELSE THAT VERY SPIDER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0000.flac NOT A SOUND IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0001.flac TO OFFER RESISTANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN MADNESS FOR EVEN HERMON PERCEIVED BY THE LOUD CLANKING OF WEAPONS AROUND THEM THE GREATLY SUPERIOR POWER OF THE ENEMY AND THEY WERE ACTING BY THE ORDERS OF THE KING TO THE PRISON NEAR THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0002.flac WAS HE TO BE LED TO THE EXECUTIONER'S BLOCK
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0003.flac WHAT PLEASURE HAD LIFE TO OFFER HIM THE BLIND MAN WHO WAS ALREADY DEAD TO HIS ART
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0004.flac OUGHT HE NOT TO GREET THIS SUDDEN END AS A BOON FROM THE IMMORTALS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0005.flac DID IT NOT SPARE HIM A HUMILIATION AS GREAT AND PAINFUL AS COULD BE IMAGINED
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0006.flac WHATEVER MIGHT AWAIT HIM HE DESIRED NO BETTER FATE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0007.flac IF HE HAD PASSED INTO ANNIHILATION HE HERMON WISHED TO FOLLOW HIM THITHER AND ANNIHILATION CERTAINLY MEANT REDEMPTION FROM PAIN AND MISERY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0008.flac BUT IF HE WERE DESTINED TO MEET HIS MYRTILUS AND HIS MOTHER IN THE WORLD BEYOND THE GRAVE WHAT HAD HE NOT TO TELL THEM HOW SURE HE WAS OF FINDING A JOYFUL RECEPTION THERE FROM BOTH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0009.flac THE POWER WHICH DELIVERED HIM OVER TO DEATH JUST AT THAT MOMENT WAS NOT NEMESIS NO IT WAS A KINDLY DEITY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0010.flac YET IT WAS NO ILLUSION THAT DECEIVED HIM
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0011.flac AGAIN HE HEARD THE BELOVED VOICE AND THIS TIME IT ADDRESSED NOT ONLY HIM BUT WITH THE UTMOST HASTE THE COMMANDER OF THE SOLDIERS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0012.flac SOMETIMES WITH TOUCHING ENTREATY SOMETIMES WITH IMPERIOUS COMMAND SHE PROTESTED AFTER GIVING HIM HER NAME THAT THIS MATTER COULD BE NOTHING BUT AN UNFORTUNATE MISTAKE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0013.flac LASTLY WITH EARNEST WARMTH SHE BESOUGHT HIM BEFORE TAKING THE PRISONERS AWAY TO PERMIT HER TO SPEAK TO THE COMMANDING GENERAL PHILIPPUS HER FATHER'S GUEST WHO SHE WAS CERTAIN WAS IN THE PALACE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0014.flac CRIED HERMON IN GRATEFUL AGITATION BUT SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN TO HIM AND FOLLOWED THE SOLDIER WHOM THE CAPTAIN DETAILED TO GUIDE HER INTO THE PALACE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0015.flac TO MORROW YOU SHALL CONFESS TO ME WHO TREACHEROUSLY DIRECTED YOU TO THIS DANGEROUS PATH
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0016.flac DAPHNE AGAIN PLEADED FOR THE LIBERATION OF THE PRISONERS BUT PHILIPPUS SILENCED HER WITH THE GRAVE EXCLAMATION THE ORDER OF THE KING
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0017.flac AS SOON AS THE CAPTIVE ARTIST WAS ALONE WITH THE WOMAN HE LOVED HE CLASPED HER HAND POURING FORTH INCOHERENT WORDS OF THE MOST ARDENT GRATITUDE AND WHEN HE FELT HER WARMLY RETURN THE PRESSURE HE COULD NOT RESTRAIN THE DESIRE TO CLASP HER TO HIS HEART
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\5484\24318\5484-24318-0018.flac IN SPITE OF HIS DEEP MENTAL DISTRESS HE COULD HAVE SHOUTED ALOUD IN HIS DELIGHT AND GRATITUDE

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0005.flac IN SPITE OF THIS DECORATION THE YOUNG MAN LOOKED POOR AS POOR AS A YOUNG MAN COULD LOOK WHO HAD SUCH A FINE HEAD AND SUCH MAGNIFICENT EYES
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0006.flac THOSE OF BASIL RANSOM WERE DARK DEEP AND GLOWING HIS HEAD HAD A CHARACTER OF ELEVATION WHICH FAIRLY ADDED TO HIS STATURE IT WAS A HEAD TO BE SEEN ABOVE THE LEVEL OF A CROWD ON SOME JUDICIAL BENCH OR POLITICAL PLATFORM OR EVEN ON A BRONZE MEDAL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0007.flac THESE THINGS THE EYES ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SMOULDERING FIRE MIGHT HAVE INDICATED THAT HE WAS TO BE A GREAT AMERICAN STATESMAN OR ON THE OTHER HAND THEY MIGHT SIMPLY HAVE PROVED THAT HE CAME FROM CAROLINA OR ALABAMA
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0008.flac AND YET THE READER WHO LIKES A COMPLETE IMAGE WHO DESIRES TO READ WITH THE SENSES AS WELL AS WITH THE REASON IS ENTREATED NOT TO FORGET THAT HE PROLONGED HIS CONSONANTS AND SWALLOWED HIS VOWELS THAT HE WAS GUILTY OF ELISIONS AND INTERPOLATIONS WHICH WERE EQUALLY UNEXPECTED AND THAT HIS DISCOURSE WAS PERVADED BY SOMETHING SULTRY AND VAST SOMETHING ALMOST AFRICAN IN ITS RICH BASKING TONE SOMETHING THAT SUGGESTED THE TEEMING EXPANSE OF THE COTTON FIELD
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0009.flac AND HE TOOK UP HIS HAT VAGUELY A SOFT BLACK HAT WITH A LOW CROWN AND AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BRIM

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0013.flac SHE WAS ATTRACTIVE AND IMPERTINENT ESPECIALLY THE LATTER

c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0017.flac THIS LAST REMARK HE MADE AT A VENTURE FOR HE HAD NATURALLY NOT DEVOTED ANY SUPPOSITION WHATEVER TO MISSUS LUNA
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0018.flac ARE YOU VERY AMBITIOUS YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0019.flac AND MISSUS LUNA ADDED THAT NOW SHE WAS BACK SHE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0020.flac ONE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT ONE HAD COME BACK FOR
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0021.flac BESIDES OLIVE DIDN'T WANT HER IN BOSTON AND DIDN'T GO THROUGH THE FORM OF SAYING SO
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0022.flac THAT WAS ONE COMFORT WITH OLIVE SHE NEVER WENT THROUGH ANY FORMS
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0023.flac SHE STOOD THERE LOOKING CONSCIOUSLY AND RATHER SERIOUSLY AT MISTER RANSOM A SMILE OF EXCEEDING FAINTNESS PLAYED ABOUT HER LIPS IT WAS JUST PERCEPTIBLE ENOUGH TO LIGHT UP THE NATIVE GRAVITY OF HER FACE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0024.flac HER VOICE WAS LOW AND AGREEABLE A CULTIVATED VOICE AND SHE EXTENDED A SLENDER WHITE HAND TO HER VISITOR WHO REMARKED WITH SOME SOLEMNITY HE FELT A CERTAIN GUILT OF PARTICIPATION IN MISSUS LUNA'S INDISCRETION THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HAPPY TO MAKE HER ACQUAINTANCE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0025.flac HE OBSERVED THAT MISS CHANCELLOR'S HAND WAS AT ONCE COLD AND LIMP SHE MERELY PLACED IT IN HIS WITHOUT EXERTING THE SMALLEST PRESSURE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0026.flac I SHALL BE BACK VERY LATE WE ARE GOING TO A THEATRE PARTY THAT'S WHY WE DINE SO EARLY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63240\6128-63240-0027.flac MISSUS LUNA'S FAMILIARITY EXTENDED EVEN TO HER SISTER SHE REMARKED TO MISS CHANCELLOR THAT SHE LOOKED AS IF SHE WERE GOT UP FOR A SEA VOYAGE
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63241\6128-63241-0000.flac POOR RANSOM ANNOUNCED THIS FACT TO HIMSELF AS IF HE HAD MADE A GREAT DISCOVERY BUT IN REALITY HE HAD NEVER BEEN SO BOEOTIAN AS AT THAT MOMENT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63241\6128-63241-0001.flac THE WOMEN HE HAD HITHERTO KNOWN HAD BEEN MAINLY OF HIS OWN SOFT CLIME AND IT WAS NOT OFTEN THEY EXHIBITED THE TENDENCY HE DETECTED AND CURSORILY DEPLORED IN MISSUS LUNA'S SISTER
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63241\6128-63241-0002.flac RANSOM WAS PLEASED WITH THE VISION OF THAT REMEDY IT MUST BE REPEATED THAT HE WAS VERY PROVINCIAL
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63241\6128-63241-0003.flac HE WAS SORRY FOR HER BUT HE SAW IN A FLASH THAT NO ONE COULD HELP HER THAT WAS WHAT MADE HER TRAGIC
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63241\6128-63241-0004.flac SHE COULD NOT DEFEND HERSELF AGAINST A RICH ADMIRATION A KIND OF TENDERNESS OF ENVY OF ANY ONE WHO HAD BEEN SO HAPPY AS TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63241\6128-63241-0005.flac HIS FAMILY WAS RUINED THEY HAD LOST THEIR SLAVES THEIR PROPERTY THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIONS THEIR HOME HAD TASTED OF ALL THE CRUELTY OF DEFEAT
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63241\6128-63241-0006.flac THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI SEEMED TO HIM THE STATE OF DESPAIR SO HE SURRENDERED THE REMNANTS OF HIS PATRIMONY TO HIS MOTHER AND SISTERS AND AT NEARLY THIRTY YEARS OF AGE ALIGHTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN NEW YORK IN THE COSTUME OF HIS PROVINCE WITH FIFTY DOLLARS IN HIS POCKET AND A GNAWING HUNGER IN HIS HEART
c:/Projects/TinyReader/TDNN\audio/test-other\6128\63241\6128-63241-0007.flac IT WAS IN THE FEMALE LINE AS BASIL RANSOM HAD WRITTEN IN ANSWERING HER LETTER WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FORM AND FLOURISH HE SPOKE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN ROYAL HOUSES
